<h5 class="lg125">A BRIEF HISTORY</h5>

<h5>OF</h5>

<h5 class="lg150">WOOD-ENGRAVING</h5>

<h5>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</h5>

<h5>CHAPTER I</h5>

<h5><i>ON THE EARLY PICTURES OF SAINTS</i></h5>

  <p>Many volumes have been written on the subject of Wood-Engraving,
  especially in Germany, Holland, and Belgium, where the art first
  flourished; as well as in Italy, France, and England; and some of the
  best of these books have been published during the present century.</p>

  <p>The most important of them are, Dr. Dibdin's celebrated
  bibliographical works; 'A Treatise on Wood-Engraving,' by W. A. Chatto,
  of which a new edition has lately been issued; 'Wood-Engraving in Italy
  in the 15th Century,' by Dr. Lippmann; and, above all, 'The Masters of
  Wood-Engraving,' a magnificent folio volume written by Mr. W. J.
  Linton&mdash;himself a Master&mdash;who, besides giving us the benefit of
  his technical knowledge obtained by the practice of the art for fifty
  years, presents us with copies, from blocks engraved by himself, of the
  most celebrated woodcuts of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.</p>

  <p>Many writers have asserted that the first wood-engravings are to be
  found on playing-cards; others maintain that <!-- Page 2 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page2"></a>{2}</span>the very rough prints on
  the playing-cards of the early fifteenth century were taken from
  stencil-plates. It is impossible to decide the point, nor is it of much
  importance; there is no evidence whatever as to the method of their
  production. They appeared in Europe about the year 1350: they came from
  the East, but their positive history, according to Dr. Willshire, begins
  in the year 1392.<a name="NtA_1" href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> It has
  been asserted that many prints of Images of Saints produced by means of
  wood-engraving preceded even playing-cards.</p>

  <p>The first undoubted fact that we can arrive at in the history of
  wood-engraving is that early in the fifteenth century there were to be
  found, in many of the monasteries and convents in various parts of
  Europe, prints of the Virgin with the Holy Infant, the most popular
  Saints, and Subjects from the Bible, which were certainly taken from
  engravings on wood; and we have now to describe some typical examples of
  primitive devotional pictures, printed by the xylographic process. The
  earliest of these woodcuts may date from 1380, and there are many which
  are assigned to the first half of the fifteenth century; they were all
  intended to be coloured by hand, and are therefore simply in outline,
  without shading. The designs are usually good, but the execution is not
  always so meritorious.</p>

  <p>In the Royal Library at Brussels there is a coloured print of <i>The
  Virgin with the Holy Child in her lap</i>, surrounded by four Saints in
  an inclosed garden. On the Virgin's right hand sits St. Catherine, with a
  royal crown on her head, the sword in her left hand, and, leaning against
  her feet, a broken wheel. Beneath is St. Dorothea crowned with roses,
  with a branch of a rose-tree in her right hand and the handle of a basket
  of apples in her left; on the other side are St. Barbara holding her
  tower, and, under her, St. Margaret with a book in her left hand; her
  right hand clasps a laidly dragon, and a cross leans upon her arm. <!--

    <i>In the Bibliothèque Royale de Belgique</i>
  </div>

<p><!-- Page 4 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page4"></a>{4}</span></p>

  <p>Outside the palings a rabbit is feeding; a bird sits on the rail
  behind St. Catherine, two others are flying, and, above all, three angels
  are offering chaplets of roses to the Virgin; a palm-tree is growing on
  each side of her. But the most important part of the print is the very
  solid three-barred gate at the entrance to the garden, for on the
  uppermost of the bars we distinctly read <b>m: cccc<sup>o</sup>
  xviii<sup>o</sup></b>. The print itself measures 14½ inches in height by
  9 inches in width, without reckoning the border lines. It was found
  pasted at the bottom of an old coffer in the possession of an innkeeper
  at Malines in 1844 by a well-known architect, M. de Noter, who,
  recognising its great importance, offered it to the Royal Library at
  Brussels. It has been reproduced in scrupulously exact facsimile and
  fully described in the work entitled 'Documents iconographiques et
  typographiques de la Bibliothèque Royale de Belgique,' published by MM.
  Muquardt of Brussels. The small letters <sup>o</sup> are supposed to
  represent nails in the gate.</p>

  <p>M. Georges Duplessis tells us that he has examined the print minutely
  several times, and that he does not believe this date has been tampered
  with in any way. Some collectors and would-be critics maintain that the
  drawing of the figures and the folds of the garments are of a later date
  than 1418; if they were to examine the works of Hubert and Jan van Eyck,
  and the paintings of Meister Stephan Lochner of Cologne, Rogier van der
  Weyden, and other artists who lived about this time, they would be
  sufficiently answered. Mr. Linton is of opinion (and there can be no
  better judge) that the <i>style</i> of the engraving does not compel him
  to attribute it to a later date than 1418, yet both he and Mr. Chatto
  express their doubts as to its authenticity&mdash;it appears to us,
  without sufficient reason.</p>

  <p>About the middle of the eighteenth century Herr Heinecken, a German
  collector of engravings, discovered, pasted <!-- Page 5 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page5"></a>{5}</span>inside the binding of a
  manuscript in the library of the convent of Buxheim in Suabia, a folio
  print brightly coloured of <i>St. Christopher bearing the Infant
  Christ</i>.</p>

  <p>The outlines are printed in black ink, not by any kind of press, but
  in much the same way as that used by wood-engravers of the present day in
  taking their proofs, who first ink the engraved surface with a printer's
  ball, then lay the paper carefully over the cut, waxed at the edges to
  hold the paper firmly, and rub the back of the paper with a burnisher. In
  the fifteenth century a roller called a <i>frotton</i> was used, as being
  more expeditious.</p>

  <p>Our illustration gives an idea of the original, which is still in the
  cover of the book in which it was discovered, and now in the Spencer
  Library at Manchester. The cut measures 11½ inches in height by 8½ inches
  in width, and is coloured after the manner of the time; that is, the
  Saint's robe is tinted with red and the lining with yellow ochre, the
  nimbuses are of the same kind of yellow; the robes of Christ and the monk
  are light blue, of the same tint as the water; the grass and foliage are
  bright green; the faces, hands, and legs are in a pale flesh-tint; there
  are but five or six colours used, and they may have been either washed in
  by hand or brushed in through a stencil-plate. As hand colouring would be
  quicker and less troublesome, one does not see the advantage of the
  stencil. The inscription beneath the cut reads thus:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><b>Cristofori faciem die quacumque tueris</b><span class="gap" style="width:5em;"></span><b>Millesimo cccc<sup>o</sup></b></p>
      <p><b>Illa nempe die morte mala non morieris</b><span class="gap" style="width:5em;"></span><b>xx<sup>o</sup> tercio</b></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>which may be rendered:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>On whatever day the face of Christopher thou shalt see,</p>
      <p>On that day no evil form of death shall visit thee.</p>
    </div>

    ST. CHRISTOPHER<br />

  </div>

<p><!-- Page 7 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page7"></a>{7}</span></p>

  <p>Mr. Linton is enthusiastic in praise of this cut. 'I am well content,'
  he says, 'to give some words of unstinted praise to our St. Christopher
  for the design. I mind not the disproportionate space he occupies in the
  picture. Is not he famous as a giant? The perspective also is good enough
  for me, as doubtless it was to those in whose interest the print was
  issued. It is certain he is crossing a stream; we see a fish beneath the
  waves. He supports his colossal frame and helps his steady course with a
  full-grown fruit-bearing palm-tree&mdash;fit staff for saintly son of
  Anak; no heathen he; the nimbus is round his head. As on his shoulders he
  bears the Lord of the World, can we fail to remark his upturned glance,
  inquiring why he is thus bowed down by a little child? The blessing hand
  of the Blessed plainly gives reply. Look again, and see on one side of
  the stream the merely secular life; is it not all expressed by the mill
  and the miller and his ass, and far up the steep road (what need for
  diminishing distance?) the peasant with the sack of flour toiling towards
  his humble home. And on the other side is the spiritual life&mdash;the
  hermit, by his windowless hut, the warning bell above; he kneels in
  front, with his lantern of faith lifted high in his hand, a beacon for
  whatever wayfarer the ferryman may bring. Rank grasses and the fearless
  rabbit mark the quiet solitude in which the hermit dwells. I can forgive
  all shortcomings. These old-century men were in earnest.'</p>

  <p>In the Spencer collection are two other prints which may be attributed
  to the same period as the St. Christopher. One is a picture of <i>The
  Annunciation</i>, which was found pasted on the end cover of the book
  (<i>Laus Virginis</i>) in which the St. Christopher was discovered. It is
  of similar size, and is printed with a dark-coloured pigment, probably by
  means of a <i>frotton</i>. The Angel Gabriel is kneeling before the
  Virgin, who also is kneeling; she holds a book in her hand, and is
  represented in a kind of Gothic chapel; a vase with flowers in it stands
  under one of the diamond-paned windows. The Holy Dove is descending in a
  flood of rays; unfortunately the figure of the Almighty has been torn
  from the top left-hand corner of the print. On one of the pillars of the
  chapel is a small scroll with the legend</p>

  <p>The wood-engraver may produce his design in two ways, either by means
  of black lines on a white ground, or by white designs on a black ground.
  The two methods are here united, while in the St. Christopher one only
  (the first) is used. Notice the discreet use of masses of black to give
  force to the design, and to contrast with the lightness of the other part
  of the picture. The Annunciation belongs to quite a different school to
  the St. Christopher.</p>

  <p>The other print is of St. Bridget of Sweden (who died in 1373). She is
  seated at a sloping desk, writing with a stylus in a book. The motto
  above her head is <b>o brigita bit got für uns</b> ('O Bridget, pray to
  God for us'). In the left upper corner is a small representation of the
  Virgin with the Holy Infant in her arms, opposite is a shield with the
  letters <span class="sm">S.P.Q.R.</span> on it, referring to her journey
  to Rome. In the lower corners are, on the left, the palm and crown of
  martyrdom; and on the right is a shield with the <i>Lion rampant</i> of
  Sweden. A pilgrim's hat and scrip hang on a staff behind the Virgin's
  seat. The print is roughly coloured, evidently by hand.</p>

  <p>Many other woodcuts of the same character have been discovered, which
  are believed to have been engraved in the first half of the fifteenth
  century. In the Imperial Library at Vienna there is a print of <i>St.
  Sebastian</i>, bearing the date 1437, which was found in the monastery of
  St. Blaise in the Black Forest. 'Having visited,' says Herr Heinecken,
  'in my last tour a great many convents in Franconia, Suabia, Bavaria, and
  in the Austrian States, I everywhere discovered in their libraries many
  of these kinds of figures engraved on wood. They were usually pasted
  either at the beginning or the end of old volumes of the fifteenth
  century. These facts have confirmed me in my opinion that the next step
  of the <!-- Page 10 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page10"></a>{10}</span>engraver on wood, after playing-cards, was
  to engrave figures of Saints, which, being distributed and lost among the
  laity, were in part preserved by the monks, who pasted them into the
  earliest printed books with which their libraries were furnished.' Herr
  Heinecken possessed more than a hundred of these pictures of Saints.
  There can be little doubt they were produced in the monasteries and
  convents, and distributed to the people, especially in the processions of
  the Church, as aids to devotion. Among the thousands of monks who lived
  in the fifteenth century there must have been many men who, like Fra
  Angelico, were gifted with sufficient artistic taste to enable them to
  draw and engrave such a picture as the St. Christopher.</p>

<h5>CHAPTER II</h5>

<h5><i>ON THE BLOCK BOOKS OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY</i></h5>

  <p>In the first half of the fifteenth century, before the invention of
  printing by means of movable type, many books were produced in which the
  woodcuts and the text were engraved on the same page, or sometimes the
  text was on one page and the woodcut opposite. They were impressed on one
  side only of the paper, and the two blank pages were often pasted
  together. They are usually called <b>Block Books</b>. Many of the cuts
  are more than ten inches in height by eight inches in width, and were
  probably cut with a knife upon smoothly planed planks of the pear-tree,
  or other fine-grained wood, or possibly some were engraved upon soft
  metal.</p>

  <p>The most celebrated of them are:</p>

  <p>and are supposed to have been issued between the years 1420 and 1440.
  There is no title-page to any of them, and the dates are generally only a
  matter of conjecture. Probably they were copies of illuminated
  manuscripts, and were drawn, engraved, and coloured by the monks in their
  <i>scriptoria</i>. Doubtless other books of a similar character may be
  existing in some of the old monasteries on the Continent at the present
  day.</p>

  <p>The Block Books appear to have been made in Germany and Holland, and
  the most popular volumes passed through many editions. The earliest
  specimens are printed in a brown ink similar to that used for distemper
  drawings. It sometimes happened that the blocks used for a book were
  afterwards cut up and used over again in a different combination (as
  noticed by Bradshaw in his 'Memoranda,' No. 3, pp. 5 and 6, and by
  William Blades, in his 'Pentateuch of Printing,' pp. 12 and 13.) A
  Block-book edition of the 'Biblia Pauperum,' printed at Zwolle, was cut
  up, and the pieces used afterwards in a different combination. The same
  was done with the blocks of the 'Speculum nostrae Salvationis,' which
  were cut up, and the pieces used again for an edition printed at Utrecht
  in 1481. This was a step in the development of the art of printing.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><b>Biblia Pauperum.</b>&mdash;In the Print Room of the British Museum
  there is a very fine copy of this work, probably the first edition. It is
  a small folio consisting of forty leaves impressed on one side only of
  the paper, in pale-brown ink or distemper, by means of friction, probably
  by a <i>frotton</i> or roller, as we can tell by the glazed surface on
  the back. The right order of the pages is indicated by the letters
  <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, <b>c</b>, &amp;c., on the face of the prints, each of
  which is about ten inches in height by seven and a-half in breadth. On
  the upper part of each page are frequently two half-length figures and
  two on the lower, intended for portraits of the prophets and other holy
  men whose writings are cited in the Latin text. <!-- Page 13 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page13"></a>{13}</span></p>

    (<i>Reduced from 10 in. by 7½ in.</i>)
  </div>

<p><!-- Page 14 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page14"></a>{14}</span></p>

  <p>The middle part of the page consists of three compartments, each of
  which is occupied by a subject from the Old or New Testament. The greater
  part of the text is at the sides of the upper portraits. On each side of
  those below is frequently a rhyming Latin verse. Texts of Scripture also
  appear on scrolls. The illustration, which is a much reduced copy of the
  tenth page (<b>k</b>), will afford a better idea of the arrangement of
  the subject and of the texts than any more lengthened description.</p>

  <p>The picture in the middle represents the Temptation of Christ by the
  Devil; that on the right, the Temptation of Adam by Eve; and that on the
  left, Esau selling his birthright for a Mess of Pottage, which his
  Brother Jacob has evidently just cooked in the iron pot suspended over
  the fire on a ratchet in the chimney-breast. The ham and goat's flesh or
  venison hanging on the kitchen wall remind us of the Dutch paintings of
  two centuries later. Esau's bow and quiver will be seen to be of a very
  primitive character.</p>

  <p>On the thirty-second page (to give another example) we find in the
  middle compartment Christ appearing to His Disciples; on the left, Joseph
  discovering himself to his Brethren; and on the right, the Return of the
  Prodigal Son.</p>

  <p>At the bottom of the page are these rhyming Latin verses:&mdash;</p>

<table class="mc" style="width:25em;">
<tr><td class="w50"><i>Under Joseph and his<br /><span class="gap"></span>Brethren.</i>
<br /><br />
Quos vex(av)it pridem<br />

<td class="w50"><i>Under the Return of the<br /><span class="gap"></span>Prodigal Son.</i>
<br /><br />
Flens amplexatur<br />
Natum pater ac recreatur.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="ac" colspan="2">Hic ihesus apparet: surgentis gloria claret.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Which have been roughly translated:</p>

<table class="mc" style="width:25em;">
<tr><td class="w50">Whom he so lately vexed<br />
He charms as brother next.</td>

<td class="w50">The wept-one is embraced<br />

  <p>The 'Biblia Pauperum,' although it could not be read by the laity, was
  evidently issued for their especial benefit, and, with the help of the
  priests, it afforded excellent lessons in Bible history. It is believed
  that the first copies were printed at Haarlem about <span
  class="sm">A.D.</span> 1430 to 1440.</p>

  <p>Five editions of the 'Biblia Pauperum' are known as block books with
  the text in Latin; two with the text in German; and several others were
  printed about 1475 with the text in movable type. At least three editions
  were printed in Holland, and seven or eight others appear to be of German
  origin; the earlier are of the Dutch School. There are four copies,
  differing editions, in the British Museum, one in the Bodleian Library,
  and one in the Spencer Library. Some of the copies are coloured in a very
  simple manner.</p>

  <p><b>Apocalypsis Sancti Johannis.</b>&mdash;This work consists of
  forty-eight pages of woodcuts about ten and a-half inches high by seven
  and a-half broad, printed in ink or distemper of a greyish-brown tint on
  thick paper on one side only. Each page is equally divided into two
  subjects, taken from the Apocalypse, one above the other. The cuts are
  engraved in the simplest manner, without any attempt at shading, as will
  be seen on examination of our print, which forms the first page of the
  book. In the upper half St. John is addressing three men and one woman.
  The words in the label <b>Conversi ab idolis per predicationem beati
  Johannis Drusiana et ceteri</b> are literally 'Drusiana and the others
  are converted from idols by the preaching of the blessed John.' The
  letter <b>a</b> indicates page 1. In the lower half we see St. John
  baptizing Drusiana in a very small font in a small chapel; outside are
  six ill-looking men trying to peep in through the chinks of the door.
  Over the chapel are the words <b>Sanctus Johannes baptisans</b>, and over
  the men <b>Cultores ydolorum explorantes facta ejus</b>, literally,
  'Worshippers of Idols spying on his acts.' Two of the idolaters are armed
  with hatchets, as if they intended to break open the door. [The Latin
  words, in accordance with the usual practice of the monks, are contracted
  in a manner very puzzling to those unused to these mediæval writings.]
  There are several editions of the Apocalypsis, all apparently of German
  origin. <!-- Page 17 --><span class="pagenum"><a

    <i>One of the earliest of the Block Books</i>
  </div>

<p><!-- Page 18 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page18"></a>{18}</span></p>

  <p>Many bibliographers, treating of block books and arguing from the very
  simple style of the drawings and engravings, consider that the
  'Apocalypsis' was the first that was produced. Many worse woodcuts were
  issued in the eighteenth century. It would be very hazardous indeed to
  fix a date by the quality of woodcut illustrations.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>In order to assist our readers in reading the text printed with the
  early woodcuts, we give them a key to the most usual abbreviations of
  Monkish Latin.</p>

  <p>1. A right line, thus (-), and a curve, thus (~), placed horizontally
  over a letter, denote: (-) 1st, over a vowel in the middle or end of a
  word, that <i>one letter</i> is wanting, <i>e.g.</i>
  v&#x113;d&#x101;t=<i>vendant</i>, bon&#x16B;=<i>bonum</i>,
  terr&#x101;=<i>terram</i>. (~) 2nd, above or through a letter=the
  omission of <i>more than one letter</i>, e.g. a&#x129;a=<i>anima</i>,
  a<img src="images/abb_ltilde.png" style="width:0.37em;" alt="symbol"
  />r=<i>aliter</i>, a<img src="images/abb_ltilde.png"

  />o=<i>ablatio</i>, Wintoñ=Wintonia, no<img src="images/abb_btilde.png"
  style="width:0.5em;" alt="symbol" />=<i>nobis</i>, &amp;c. A straight
  line through a consonant also denotes the omission of one or more
  letters, <i>e.g.</i> vo<img src="images/abb_bbar.png"
  style="width:0.53em;" alt="symbol" />=<i>vobis</i>, q&#x111;=<i>quod</i>,

  style="width:0.5em; position:relative; top:0.67ex;" alt="symbol"

  src="images/abb_pro.png" style="width:0.53em; position:relative;
  top:0.53ex;" alt="symbol" />=<i>pro</i>.</p>

  <p>5. The character <img src="images/abb_us.png" style="width:0.37em;

<h5>CHAPTER III</h5>

<h5><i>THE BLOCK BOOKS OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY</i></h5>

<h5>(<i>continued</i>).</h5>

  <p><b>Ars Moriendi.</b>&mdash;Of all the block books known to us, this
  bears the palm for artistic merit. It is probable that the 'Ars Moriendi'
  is of later date than the block books already described. Mr. George
  Bullen (Holbein Society, 'Ars Moriendi,' 1881, p. 4) was of opinion that
  the first edition was printed at Cologne in Germany about the middle of
  the fifteenth century. Others say that the quarto edition is the earlier.
  The illustrations belong to the lower Rhenish School, which, about the
  middle of the fifteenth century, was influenced by the style of Roger van
  der Weyde, and probably also by the work of some of the pupils of the Van
  Eycks. There are eleven woodcuts, about eight and a-half inches, by five
  and a-half inches, without including the frame-lines, printed on separate
  pages, and thirteen pages of text, all impressed on one side only of the
  paper. Five of the pictures represent a sick man in bed tempted by
  devils&mdash;I. To Unbelief; II. To Despair and Suicide; III. To
  Impatience of Good Advice; IV. To Vainglory; and V. To Avarice. In the
  five opposite pictures the sick man is attended by Good Angels, who
  refute the arguments of the demons. In the eleventh print we witness the
  death of the sick man. The drawings are somewhat similar in manner to the
  works of Roger van der Weyde, who lived in the early part of the
  fifteenth century. <!-- Page 21 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page21"></a>{21}</span>It was a time when art was beginning to
  awake from its long sleep, and such works as the 'Ars Moriendi' were far
  in advance of any we know of belonging to the previous century.</p>

  <p>One of the best of the illustrations is from the last temptation:
  <i>temptacio diaboli de avaricia</i>, and is probably intended to be the
  presentation of a dream. The sick man's bed is on the roof of his house!
  A diabolus, as tall as the house, points to a youth&mdash;possibly the
  heir, who is leading a very Flemish-looking horse into a
  doorway&mdash;and says, <b>Intende thesauro</b>&mdash;take care of your
  treasures. The figures by the bedside must represent the father and
  mother, wife, sisters, and young son of the dying man. The diabolus on
  his right says <b>Provideas amicis</b>&mdash;'You may provide for your
  friends.' The heads of the diaboli in this print are more laughable than
  terrible, and suggest the make-up of a pantomime rather than the demons
  who are messengers of the Evil One. On the next page an angel gives good
  counsel to the dying man, a figure of Christ on the cross is at his bed's
  head, and the Mother of Christ blesses him. A group of relations and
  friends still attend him, and beside them are sheep and oxen. In the
  foreground an angel is driving away a man and woman, who are evidently in
  great grief, and a crouching demon says, <b>Quid faciam</b>&mdash;'What
  can I do?' Pictures like this appealed forcibly to the minds of the laity
  in the middle ages, and were doubtless fully explained to the uneducated
  by the religious dwellers in the monasteries and convents which at that
  time abounded throughout Europe.</p>

  <p>A reproduction of this book was issued a few years since by the
  Holbein Society. The designs were copied in careful pen-and-ink drawings
  by Mr. F. Price, and the text was translated and the pictures described
  by Mr. George Bullen, who also wrote a learned preface, enumerating the
  various editions of the book which are known to have been printed in
  different languages. Weigel printed a photographic reproduction of this
  book in 1869. <!-- Page 22 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page22"></a>{22}</span></p>

  <p>The 'Ars Moriendi' was the most popular of all the block books. Before
  the end of the fifteenth century eight different editions had been
  issued, seven of them in Latin and one in French. M. Passavant states
  that he had met with thirty different imitations of it issued in Germany
  and Holland.</p>

  <p>There is but one quite perfect copy of the first edition of this book
  known, and this fortunately is in the British Museum. It was bought at
  the Weigel sale in Leipsic in 1872 for the large sum of £1,072
  10<i>s.</i>, exclusive of commission.</p>

  prefigured in 'The Song of Songs which is Solomon's.' This is a much more
  pleasing book than the 'Apocalypsis.' The figures are more gracefully
  designed and the engraver has shown much more knowledge of his art; the
  indications of shading are in many instances very happily given. It
  consists of only sixteen leaves with two subjects, one above the other on
  each leaf; each picture is five inches high by seven wide, and is printed
  by means of friction in dark-brown ink or distemper, on thick paper.</p>

  <p>Our illustration is from the second leaf. In the upper subject we see
  the Bride and Bridegroom conversing, two maidens attending. The words on
  the scroll on the left are <b>Trahe me: post te curremus in odorem
  unguentorum tuorum</b>, 'Draw me, we will run after thee: because of the
  savour of thy good ointments' (Song of Solomon, ch. i., v. 4 and 3). On
  the scroll to the right, <b>Sonet vox tua in auribus meis, vox enim tua
  dulcis et facies tua decora</b>, 'Let me hear thy voice, for sweet is thy
  voice and thy countenance is comely' (Song of Solomon, ch. ii., verse
  14). In the lower subject, in which the Bride is seen seated by her
  maidens and the Bridegroom is standing near, on the left-hand scroll we
  read, <b>En dilectus meus loquitur mihi, Surge, propera, amica mea</b>,
  'My beloved spake and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and
  come away' (ch. ii., verse 10); and on the right, <b>Quam pulchra es
  amica mea, quam pulchra es! oculi tui columbarum, absque eo quod
  intrinsecus latet</b>, 'How beautiful art thou, my love, how beautiful
  art thou! thy eyes are doves' eyes, besides what is hid within' (ch. iv.
  1). <!-- Page 23 --><span class="pagenum"><a

    CANTICUM CANTICORUM&mdash;SECOND LEAF<br />
    (<i>Much reduced</i>)
  </div>

<p><!-- Page 24 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page24"></a>{24}</span></p>

  <p>On the sixth leaf, the Bride and Bridegroom are eating grapes in a
  vineyard, three maidens attending, all seated. In the cut below, the
  Bridegroom is standing outside a garden wall over which the Bride is
  watching him. An angel is entering the gate, other angels with drawn
  swords are on the wall.</p>

  <p>It is supposed that these engravings were executed in the Netherlands:
  the female figures are said to be in the costume of the Court of
  Burgundy! There are several shields of arms to be found in three of the
  subjects, and these have given rise to long dissertations by writers on
  heraldry. Mr. Chatto's book has engravings of eighteen of them with
  descriptions. One is the shield of Alsace, another of the house of
  Würtemberg, a third of the city of Ratisbon; and the cross-keys, the
  <i>fleur-de-lis</i>, the black spread-eagle, and a rose (much like our
  Tudor rose), may be seen on others. Several copies of the 'Canticum' have
  been found, coloured and uncoloured. Two editions of the Canticum
  Canticorum are known; both appear to have emanated from Holland and the
  Low Countries, and both bear clear traces of the influence of the school
  of the Van Eycks.</p>

  <p><b>The Figure Alphabet.</b>&mdash;In the Print Room of the British
  Museum there is a curious little book (six inches by four inches in size)
  in which nearly all the letters of the alphabet are formed by grotesque
  figures of men. Except that it was bequeathed to the Museum by Sir George
  Beaumont, no one knows anything of its history; but internal evidence
  warrants us in attributing it to the work of an engraver of the first
  half of the fifteenth century. The cuts are printed in a kind of
  sepia-coloured distemper which can be easily wiped off by means of
  moisture. There is one very curious thing connected with this work. In
  the cut forming the <!-- Page 25 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page25"></a>{25}</span>letter L a young man is leaning on a sword,
  on the blade of which is plainly written <b>London</b>, and on the cloak
  of the youth lying below we read, in a current hand usual at that date,
  the word <i>Bethemsted</i>. The figures, grotesque as they are, were
  drawn by a better artist than those who designed the block books. We know
  that the art of engraving was in a very low state in England at the time
  we are speaking of; we should therefore rejoice if we could anyhow prove
  that these very early specimens of wood-cutting were done in this
  country.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:19%;">
      <a href="images/i_036.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/i_036.png"
      alt="Letter F" title="Letter F" /></a>
  </div>
  <p>In the letter F, which we have given as an illustration, very much
  reduced from the original, a tall man is blowing a very long trumpet; a
  youth, bending down to form the crotch of the letter, is beating a tabor;
  while a nondescript animal lies couched at his feet.</p>

  <p>Many other block books exist in the British Museum, the Bodleian
  Library, Oxford, the Spencer Library, Manchester, and in the large
  libraries on the Continent besides those we have mentioned. Some were
  printed, long after the introduction of printing, in Venice and in the
  cities of Lower Germany.</p>

  <p>Before the beginning of the fifteenth century we have no record of any
  examples of wood-engraving of an artistic kind, except, as we have said,
  the designs on playing-cards, and the workmanship of these, whether it
  was by woodcuts or by a stencil-plate, was very crude. The art really
  came into existence in the first quarter of that famous fifteenth
  century. There were scores of men at that time who could carve
  excellently well in stone or wood, or who could design <!-- Page 26
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page26"></a>{26}</span>and make
  beautiful jewels, and some of these men, probably monks in their
  monasteries, as well as secular craftsmen, drew and cut the first
  wood-engraving. No one knows who they were.</p>

  <p>Up to the year 1475 the original method of wood-cutting changed very
  little; nearly every print was in outline with a thick and a thin line. A
  few, such as those in the 'Ars Moriendi,' had a little shading of the
  most primitive kind. They were intended to be coloured, and, among the
  prints that have been preserved, experts say they can detect the manner
  of colouring prevalent in Upper or Lower Germany, the Rhine Provinces, or
  the Netherlands. Towards the end of the century came a transition.
  Shading was introduced and even cross-hatching was executed by the best
  wood-engravers of the time. The art took, as it were, a sudden bound, and
  in a few years attained a height which we at the end of the nineteenth
  century find it hard to excel. But of this we must speak in a future
  chapter.</p>

  <p><b>Ars Memorandi.</b>&mdash;This very curious book&mdash;much more
  curious than beautiful&mdash;contains fifteen designs and the same number
  of pages of engraved text. The designs are intended to assist the memory
  in reading the Gospels, and perhaps to assist the friars in preaching to
  the people. To the Gospel of St. John, with which the book begins, there
  are three cuts allotted, and as many pages of text; to St. Matthew five
  cuts and five pages of text; to St. Mark, three cuts and three pages of
  text; and to St. Luke, four cuts and four pages of text.</p>

  <p>In every print an allegorical figure is represented; an eagle
  symbolical of St. John, an angel of St. Matthew, a lion of St. Mark, and
  an ox of St. Luke.</p>

  <p>The first cut is intended to represent, figuratively, the first six
  chapters of St. John's Gospel. An upright eagle, with spread wings and
  claws, has three human heads&mdash;that of the Saint with a dove above it
  is in the middle, the head <!-- Page 27 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page27"></a>{27}</span>of Christ is on its right, and that of Moses
  on its left. A lute, from which three bells depend, lies across the
  eagle's breast; this is supposed to refer to the Marriage in Cana, and a
  little numeral tells us that the account of it is in the second chapter.
  Between the outspread claws is a bucket surmounted by a crown. These are
  symbolical of the Well of Samaria and the Nobleman's son at Capernaum in
  chapter iv. On the bend of the eagle's outspread right wing is a fish and
  the numeral 5, referring to the Pool of Bethesda in chapter v., and on
  the left wing are five barley loaves and two small fishes, and a small 6,
  referring to the parable of the loaves and fishes in the sixth chapter.
  This very singular book must have been a great favourite with the
  priests, and perhaps with the laity, for it was reprinted over and over
  again. It appears to have been of German origin.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Of the other block books mentioned in chapter ii. it would be tedious
  to give an account; they are very similar to those we have just
  described.</p>

<h5>CHAPTER IV</h5>

<h5><i>SPECULUM HUMANÆ SALVATIONIS</i></h5>

  <p>Historians tell us that in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the
  cities of the Netherlands were the most populous and the richest in all
  Western Europe. Bruges, Ghent, Liège and Brussels by their manufactures,
  and Antwerp by her commerce, in which she rivalled Venice, had become
  celebrated for their great wealth, the grandeur of their rulers, and the
  magnificence of their great Guilds. The more northern towns, too,
  Amsterdam, Haarlem, and Utrecht, and many cities of Germany, such as
  Mentz, Cologne, Strasburg, Nürnberg, Augsburg, and Basel, were rich and
  prosperous. It was among these cities that the sister arts of printing
  and wood-engraving first flourished.</p>

  <p>From undoubted evidence accumulated by the patience and labour of many
  bibliographers, it appears that the art of printing by means of movable
  type was not invented by any one man, but was the result of a gradual
  development of the art of engraving. In the fifteenth century, as in the
  nineteenth, there was an ever-growing demand for school books. One of the
  most popular of these in the fifteenth century was the 'Donatus,' a
  grammar so called from the name of the author. There was also a Latin
  Delectus called a 'Catho.' These were cheap books and were usually
  printed from engraved wood blocks. These and the block books already
  described were contemporary, and the immediate forerunners of separate
  types. (See Blades, 'Pentateuch of Printing,' p. 12.) <!-- Page 29
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page29"></a>{29}</span></p>

  <p>In certain editions of the 'Speculum' there are to be seen woodcuts
  printed in ink of one colour and text in ink of another colour, from
  metal movable types. These types are rude in the extreme, far more so
  than the German Indulgence of 1454, the very earliest known dated piece
  of printing. There is no doubt that the Donatuses were at first printed
  from wood blocks, both in Germany and the Low Countries, but there is not
  a single Dutch block-book Donatus known, while there are some nineteen or
  twenty early type-printed Dutch Donatuses already catalogued. Therefore
  it appears likely that Gutenberg simply developed the process which had
  already been for some time in use in the Low Countries for Donatuses and
  similar books.</p>

      alt="First Page of the Speculum Humanæ Salvationis" title="First Page of the Speculum Humanæ Salvationis" /></a>
    FIRST PAGE OF THE SPECULUM HUMANÆ SALVATIONIS
  </div>

  <p>The first book of importance that was printed at a press <!-- Page 30
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page30"></a>{30}</span>and from movable
  type was the celebrated Bible<a name="NtA_2"
  href="#Nt_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> which Gutenberg produced at Mentz about
  the year 1455. About the same time it is asserted that Laurent Janszoon
  Coster of Haarlem issued the <i>Speculum Humanæ Salvationis</i>, and much
  discussion has risen as to which book has the prior claim. The Dutch
  insist on Coster as being the proto-printer; the Germans not only assert
  the claim of Gutenberg but say that Coster is a myth! The controversy is
  still carried on and there is little likelihood that it will ever be
  decided.</p>

  <p>In the year 1462 there was a small revolution in Mentz, owing to the
  rival claims of two Archbishops, and the city was sacked. The printers in
  the employment of Gutenberg and his partners, Fust and Peter Schoeffer,
  were scattered in every direction. Fifteen years afterwards
  printing-presses were to be found in every large city of Germany and the
  Netherlands, as well as in Italy and France; and about 1477, Caxton set
  up his first press in the precincts of Westminster Abbey.</p>

  <p><i>Speculum Humanae Salvationis</i>&mdash;'The Mirror of Man's
  Salvation.'&mdash;This was the first book, printed from type, that had
  wood engravings. It is a small folio containing fifty-eight cuts, each of
  which is divided into two subjects, inclosed in an architectural frame,
  in which is the title in Latin. The cuts are placed at the head of the
  pages, of which they occupy one-third. It is to be noticed that, though
  the cuts are all printed in brown ink, the text beneath them is printed
  in black: probably because the prints were to be coloured.</p>

  <p>The arrangement and scope of this work are much like those of the
  'Biblia Pauperum'; the subjects are taken from the Old and New
  Testaments, including the Apocrypha, and a few are from classic
  history.</p>

  <p>The illustrations are from the first page: <b>Casus <!-- Page 31
  --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page31"></a>{31}</span>Luciferi</b>&mdash;'The Fall of
  Lucifer'&mdash;and <b>Deus creavit hominem ad ymaginem et similitudinem
  suam</b>&mdash;'God created Man after His own image and likeness.'</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:45%;">

    (<i>Size of the original cut</i>)
  </div>

<p><!-- Page 32 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page32"></a>{32}</span></p>

  <p>We see that the arts of drawing and engraving had improved since the
  time of the 'Biblia Pauperum.' The figures are in better proportion: in
  many of the designs the folds of the dress fall more gracefully and the
  shading is more artistically done. There are four fifteenth-century
  editions of this work known, two with the text in Dutch, and two in
  Latin. Three editions are printed entirely with movable type, while part
  of the fourth&mdash;the second Latin edition&mdash;is certainly from
  engraved blocks. No one can tell the reason of this curious
  anomaly&mdash;we can only conjecture. Experts tell the various editions
  by the state of the cuts; when these are unblemished, it is assumed that
  they are of the first edition; when a few of the lines of the cuts are
  broken, it is supposed that they belong to the second edition; when many
  are broken, to the third edition, and so on.</p>

  <p>Mr. Woodbery<a name="NtA_3" href="#Nt_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> has so
  graphically described the 'Speculum' that we cannot do better than quote
  his words: 'A whole series needs to be looked at before one can
  appreciate the interest which these designs have in indicating the
  subjects on which imagination and thought were then exercised, and the
  modes in which they were exercised. Symbolism and mysticism pervade the
  whole. All nature and history seem to have existed only to prefigure the
  life of the Saviour: imagination and thought hover about Him, and take
  colour, shape, and light only from that central form; the stories of the
  Old Testament, the histories of David, Samson, and Jonah, the massacres,
  victories, and miracles there recorded, foreshadow, as it were in
  parables, the narrative of the Gospels; the temple, the altar, and the
  ark of the covenant, all the furnishings and observances of the Jewish
  ritual, reveal occult meanings; the garden of Solomon's Song, and the
  sentiment of the Bridegroom and the Bride who wander in it, are
  interpreted, sometimes in graceful or even poetic feeling, under the
  inspiration of mystical devotion; old kings of pagan Athens are
  transformed into witnesses of Christ, and, with the Sibyl of Rome, attest
  spiritual truth. <!-- Page 33 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page33"></a>{33}</span></p>

  </div>

<p><!-- Page 34 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page34"></a>{34}</span></p>

  <p>This book and others like it are mirrors of the ecclesiastical mind;
  they picture the principal intellectual life of the Middle Ages; they
  show the sources of that deep feeling in the earlier Dutch artists which
  gave dignity and sweetness to their works. Even in the rudeness of these
  books, in the texts as well as in the designs, there is a <i>naïveté</i>,
  an openness and freshness of nature, a confidence in limited experience
  and contracted vision, which make the sight of these cuts as charming as
  conversation with one who had never heard of America or dreamed of
  Luther, and who would have found modern life a puzzle and an offence. The
  author of the <i>Speculum</i> laments the evils which fell upon man in
  consequence of Adam's sin, and recounts them: blindness, deafness,
  lameness, floods, fire, pestilence, wild beasts, and law-suits (in such
  order he arranges them); and he ends the long list with this last and
  heaviest evil, that men should presume to ask "why God willed to create
  man, whose fall He foresaw; why He willed to create the angels, whose
  ruin He foreknew; wherefore He hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and
  softened the heart of Mary Magdalene unto repentance; wherefore He made
  Peter contrite, who had denied Him thrice, but allowed Judas to despair
  in his sin; wherefore He gave grace to one thief, and cared not to give
  grace to his companion." What modern man can fully realise the mental
  condition of this poet, who thus weeps over the temptation to ask these
  questions, as the supreme and direst curse which Divine vengeance allows
  to overtake the perverse children of this world?'</p>

  <p>By far the most excellent book issued about this time is <b>The
  Psalter</b>, printed by Gutenberg's former partners, Fust and Schoeffer,
  at Mentz in 1459. The initial letters, which are printed in red and blue
  and the Gothic type, all of which are in exact imitation of the best
  manuscripts, could not be excelled at the present day. The book belongs
  more to the History of Printing, but on account of its beautiful initial
  letters, which, it is said, were drawn and engraved by Schoeffer, we feel
  constrained to notice it. <!-- Page 35 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>A <i>Book of Fables</i> issued from the press of Albrecht Pfister, of
  Bamberg, in 1461, may be mentioned as a very early work in which woodcuts
  and type were printed together; it is a small folio of twenty-eight
  leaves, containing eighty-five fables in rhyme in the old German
  language, illustrated with a hundred and one cuts. They are of little
  merit and show no advancement in the art of wood-engraving. The only
  known copy of this book, which is in the Wolfenbüttel Library, was taken
  away by the French under Napoleon's orders and added to the Bibliothèque
  Nationale; it was restored at the surrender of Paris in 1815.</p>

  <p>We cannot give a list of all the books containing woodcuts that were
  issued in Germany at the end of the fifteenth century; their name is
  legion. We must, however, mention two or three of the most important.</p>

  <p>In the <b>Cologne Bible</b>, printed about the year 1475, there are
  one hundred and nine cuts, one of which we give as an example; they are
  about equal in merit to those in the 'Biblia Pauperum,' but show no
  improvement. The subject of the cut is 'The Grief of Hannah.' We see
  Elkanah and his two wives, Hannah and Peninnah, in a room from which the
  artist has obligingly taken away one of the sides. In the Nürnberg Bible,
  printed in 1482, we find the same set of cuts.</p>

  <p>The <b>Nürnberg Chronicle</b>, often quoted as an example of early
  German wood-engraving, is a folio volume containing more than two
  thousand cuts, which include views of cities, portraits of saints and
  other holy men, scenes from Biblical and profane history, and a great
  many other subjects, produced, we are told, under the superintendence of
  Michael Wolgemuth and William Pleydenwurff, 'mathematical men skilled in
  the art of painting.' The same head does duty for the portrait of a dozen
  or more historians or poets&mdash;the <!-- Page 37 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page37"></a>{37}</span>same portrait is given to
  many military heroes&mdash;the saints are treated in the same way, and
  even the same view serves for several different cities. The cuts are
  bolder and more full of colour than any we have had before, and so far
  may be said to be in advance, and this we must put down to the
  superintendence of Wolgemuth, who was an artist of repute. Chatto says
  they are the most tasteless and worthless things that are to be found in
  any book, ancient or modern&mdash;but this is too sweeping an assertion.
  The work was compiled by Hartman Schedel, a physician of Nürnberg, and
  printed in that city by Anthony Koburger in 1493.</p>

  <p>The most important book of this time, so far as the woodcuts are
  concerned, is a Latin edition of <b>Breydenbach's Travels</b>, which was
  printed in folio by Erhard Reuwich in Mentz in 1486. We give a much
  reduced copy of the frontispiece, which is without doubt the best example
  of wood-engraving of the fifteenth century. In this cut we see for the
  first time cross-hatching used in the shadows, in the folds of the
  drapery of the principal figure&mdash;Saint Catherine, who is the
  patroness of learned men&mdash;in the upper parts of the shields and
  beneath the top part of the frame. Bernard de Breydenbach, who was a
  canon of the cathedral of Mentz, was accompanied in his travels to the
  Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem and the shrine of St. Catherine on Mount
  Sinai by John, Count of Solms and Lord of Mintzenberg, and Philip de
  Bicken, Knight. The arms of the three travellers are given in the cut
  with the names beneath them. Besides the frontispiece there are many
  other good engravings in this volume&mdash;a picture of Venice, five feet
  long and ten inches high; views of Corfu, Modon, in Southern Greece, and
  the country round Jerusalem. There are also many pictures of animals,
  such as a giraffe, a unicorn, a salamander, a camel, and a creature
  something like an ouran-outang. Travellers saw wonderful things in those
  days! It is a great pity that we do not know the names of the artists
  <!-- Page 38 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page38"></a>{38}</span>who
  drew and engraved the cuts in this most interesting book.</p>

    THE BIBLIOMANIAC<br />
    <i>From 'Navis Stultifera' (The Ship of Fools)</i>
  </div>

  <p>Just at the close of the century we find the first humorous conception
  of German artists in the illustrations of the <b>Navis Stultifera</b>
  (Ship of Fools), written by Sebastian Brandt and printed at Basel in
  1497. This very bold and original work had an immense success and was
  frequently reprinted. Every page is adorned with the antics of clowns and
  men in fools' caps and bells, in caricature of some absurdity, and the
  bibliomaniac is not spared: 'I have the first place among fools,' he is
  made to say; 'I have heaps of books which I <!-- Page 39 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page39"></a>{39}</span>rarely open. If I read
  them I forget them and am no wiser.' As will be seen by the cut, though
  the perspective of the draughtsman is not to be praised, the work of the
  engraver is excellent; the fineness of the lines is new to us and the
  shadows are well treated. Notice also the bindings of the books, with
  their bosses, hinges, and clasps; nearly all are folios, and four or five
  are ornamented with the same pattern. The decoration at the side is
  evidently copied from an illuminated manuscript. With this book we may
  fitly close our notice of German wood-engraving of the fifteenth
  century.</p>

<h5>CHAPTER V</h5>

<h5><i>ON WOOD-ENGRAVING IN ITALY IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY</i></h5>

  <p>Although at this time Germany took the lead of all European countries
  so far as the illustrations of printed books are concerned, the
  transition from German to Italian art is like the change from the strong
  bleak winds of the North to the balmy air and sunny skies of the South.
  We are aware of the difference both of climate and of art in a moment:
  the very first picture presented to us reveals it. The Italians of the
  fifteenth century could not take up a handicraft without making it a fine
  art. Here is a title-page of a folio <span class="sc">Kalendario</span>
  produced in Venice in the year 1476. This is the first title-page on
  which the contents of the book, the name of the author, the imprint of
  the publishers, who were also the printers, and the date of the issue of
  the book, were ever given. Mark the decoration. Though the publishers
  were Germans, the artist who drew this border must have been an Italian;
  and probably the engraver was an Italian also, for the book was produced
  at Venice. The character of the design suggests the work of an
  illuminator. The introduction of the printing-press must have interfered
  sadly with the writer of manuscripts and his brother the illuminator, and
  both were doubtless glad to avail themselves of the new art. The
  manuscript writer may have turned compositor, and the illuminator may
  have been transformed into a book decorator. <!-- Page 41 --><span

  <p>We have before us a facsimile of a cut called 'The Triumph of Love,'
  which appeared as one of the illustrations of <span class="sc">Triumphi
  del Petrarca</span>, a book printed in Venice, in 1488. A man, seated
  with his hands bound behind him, is tied with a rope to a triumphal car
  which is drawn by four horses; on a ball of fire, which rises from the
  car, a blindfolded Cupid is shooting an arrow (apparently at the near
  leader); a great crowd of men and women, among whom we see a king and a
  mitred bishop, follow and surround the car, and on a distant hill we
  behold Petrarch conversing with his friend. There are two rabbits feeding
  calmly in the <!-- Page 42 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page42"></a>{42}</span>foreground, notwithstanding the danger of
  the horses' hoofs, and the usual conventional designs for grass and
  flowers. The groundwork of the border of this curious print is black,
  with an Italian design carefully cut out in white, with but little
  shadow. From the waviness of many of the lines which should be straight,
  we think this print must be from an engraving on metal.</p>

  <p>Of all the wood-engravings executed in Italy in the fifteenth century,
  none can compare in excellence with those in the <span
  class="sc">Hypnerotomachia Poliphili</span> (Dream of Poliphilo) printed
  in Venice, by Aldus, in 1499.<a name="NtA_4"
  href="#Nt_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> There are, in all, one hundred and
  ninety-two subjects, of which eighty-six relate to mythology and ancient
  history, fifty-four are pictures of processions and emblematic figures,
  thirty-six are architectural and ornamental, and sixteen vases and
  statues. They have been attributed to many different artists, the most
  probable of whom is Carpaccio. The subject of the 'Hypnerotomachia' has
  been described as a 'Contest between Imagination and Love'; it is a
  curious medley of all kinds of fable, history, architecture, mathematics,
  and other matters, seasoned with suggestions which do not reflect credit
  on the moral perceptions of its author, a Dominican monk, named Francesco
  Colonna. An enthusiastic admirer of this book thus poetically describes
  it: 'There is, perhaps, no volume where the exuberant vigour of that age
  is more clearly shown, or where the objects for which that age was
  impassioned are more glowingly described. <!-- Page 43 --><span

    POLIPHILO IN THE GARDEN<br />
    <i>From 'Hypnerotomachia Poliphili,' printed by Aldus at Venice in
    1499</i>
  </div>

  <p>The romantic and fantastic rhapsody mirrors every aspect of nature and
  art in which the Italians then took delight&mdash;peaceful landscape,
  where rivers flow by flower-starred banks and through bird-haunted woods;
  noble architecture and exquisite sculpture, <!-- Page 44 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page44"></a>{44}</span>the music of soft
  instruments, the ruins of antiquity, the legends of old mythology, the
  motions of the dance, the elegance of the banquet, splendour of apparel,
  courtesy of manners, even the manuscript, with its cover of purple velvet
  sown with Eastern pearls&mdash;everything that was cared for and sought
  in that time when the gloom of asceticism lifted and disclosed the wide
  prospect of the world lying, as it were, in the loveliness of daybreak.'
  But it is more on account of the beauty of the cuts than the poetry of
  the author that this book has been so much admired and so frequently
  reprinted. Our illustration shows us where Poliphilo in his dream visits
  a bevy of fair maidens in a garden. These nymphs are not very beautiful,
  but, though they have such high waists, remark how gracefully their
  figures are drawn, and look at the action and the drapery of the damsel
  running away. The engraving is, without doubt, an exact facsimile of the
  artist's drawing; the lines are clear and crisp, and are evidently the
  work of a practised hand. The drawing of the gateway and trees is simply
  conventional. We are sorry that we have not room for more of the
  illustrations of this remarkable work.</p>

  <p>In these early books it seems to have been nobody's business to record
  the name of the engraver who produced the illustrations, and, although
  the printer's name is generally very conspicuous in the colophon, the
  artist's name rarely, if ever, appears. But the work of certain masters
  of certain schools is generally recognised with ease, either by some
  peculiarity of manner, or by some particular mark. Thus one artist, who,
  towards the end of the fifteenth century, illustrated a few books printed
  in Italy, is known as 'the master of the dolphin,' because in most of his
  work this fish appears among the decorations. Another is known to us only
  by the name of 'the illustrator of the "Poliphilus,"' that quaint romance
  of Colonna which has taken a proud place in literature, not for its own
  intrinsic merits, but <!-- Page 45 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page45"></a>{45}</span>rather on account of the beauty of its
  woodcuts, the name of whose author is still a matter of conjecture.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>We may here say a few words about Aldo Manuzio, better known in
  England by his Latinised name, Aldus Manutius, the celebrated printer,
  and some of the other early printers of Venice. One of the first to set
  up a press in Venice was Nicolas Jenson, a Frenchman, who had worked at
  Mentz, and who was the first to cut and introduce Roman type such as is
  now in use. At his death his business and plant were bought by a rich
  man, Andrea Torresano, of Asola, and the work was carried on
  successfully. Aldo Manuzio, who was born at Sermoneta, a village near
  Velletri, in 1450, received an excellent education, especially in Greek;
  and the celebrated Pico da Mirandola made him tutor to his nephews,
  Alberto and Leonardo Pio, Lords of Carpi. Alberto Pio, under his master's
  training, became a great lover of literature; and when Aldo conceived the
  idea of starting a printing-press, the young lord advanced him the
  necessary funds, and gave him a house in Venice near the Church of Sant'
  Agostino. Aldo then married a daughter of Torresano, and the two printing
  businesses were joined and carried on together under Aldo's direction.
  His house, we are told, was a veritable colony; besides the compositors'
  rooms and the press-rooms, he had closets for press-readers and studios
  for the special use of learned authors. The first 'printer's devil' was a
  little negro boy who had been brought by one of the men from Greece.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>At the beginning of the sixteenth century the wood-engravers of
  Florence were celebrated for beautiful book illustrations in a distinct
  style. Those in the <span class="sc">Quatro Reggie</span>, Florence,
  1508, are typical examples; their chief characteristics are, great
  breadth; masses of white and black <!-- Page 46 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page46"></a>{46}</span>evenly balanced; and the
  frequent use of white lines out of masses of black.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:45%;">

      alt="Teobaldo Manuzio" title="Teobaldo Manuzio" /></a>
    TEOBALDO MANUZIO&mdash;KNOWN AS ALDUS, PRINTER AT VENICE
  </div>

  <p>Some of the fine borders to these early Italian wood-engravings owe
  their distinctive character to earlier work of <!-- Page 47 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page47"></a>{47}</span>engravers on metal. Thus
  the borders round the illustrations of the Venice folio of 1491 of the
  <span class="sc">Triumphs of Petrarch</span> seem to be direct copies of
  engravings in metal by Filippo Lippi. The masses of white on a black
  background are very effective, and the strength of the colour increases
  the effect of the picture which the border surrounds.</p>

  <p>Between 1474 and 1512 Aldus printed for the first time the works of
  thirty-three Greek authors. The works of Aristotle, brought out in four
  volumes, occupied three years. A learned Greek, Musurus of Crete,
  corrected the proofs, in which Aldus himself assisted. The workmen were
  nearly all Greeks. The Greek type was copied from the handwriting of
  Musurus, and the Italian, known as the Aldine, from the writings of
  Petrarch; this was cut by the celebrated artist-goldsmith, Francia of
  Bologna. The Aldine edition of Virgil (1501), now exceedingly rare, was
  the first book printed in this Italic type. Notwithstanding all his
  learning, energy, and philanthropy, Aldus did not succeed in his
  business. Many of his books were pirated, wars and insurrections
  interrupted him, the League of Cambray caused him to close his works from
  1506 to 1510, and he sold his books at a rate too cheap to be
  remunerative.</p>

  <p>The first printed edition of <span class="sc">Æsop's Fables</span>,
  which appeared at Verona as early as 1481, and was reprinted at Venice in
  1491, contains many excellent engravings inclosed in ornamental borders,
  thoroughly Italian in character. The figures are not unlike those in the
  'Hypnerotomachia,' and we can readily imagine that they were drawn by the
  same artist, who has given us little more than outlines, which the
  engraver has well cut in facsimile. The fable of 'The Jackdaw and the
  Peacock' is particularly well done. An edition of <span class="sc">Ovid's
  Metamorphoses</span> appeared also at this time with tolerably good
  illustrations not so well engraved.</p>

  <p>There are some curious little cuts in the <span class="sc">Epistole di
  San Hieronymo Volgare</span>, published in Ferrara in 1497, which <!--
  Page 48 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page48"></a>{48}</span>are more
  valuable for their originality than their beauty, either of drawing or
  engraving. The book was evidently intended for the use of the illiterate,
  to whom the quality of the pictures laid before them was of little
  consequence if they told the story that was meant for them to read with
  their eyes. The homely scene of Christ appearing like a Gardener with a
  hoe on His shoulder, addressing Mary Magdalene in an Italian
  <i>pergola</i>, would appeal to their feelings much more directly than
  the Transfiguration of Raphael.</p>

    <i>From the 'Decameron,' printed in Venice in 1492</i>
  </div>

  <p>We do not find record of any other important wood-engravings in the
  history of printing in Italy at the end of the fifteenth century. Presses
  abounded everywhere, chiefly managed by Germans; there was scarcely an
  important town in Italy without a printer; few illustrated books,
  however, were issued at this time. An edition of Boccaccio's <!-- Page 49
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page49"></a>{49}</span>'<span
  class="sc">Decameron</span>,' with many excellent cuts, one of which,
  representing a bootmaker's shop, we give as an illustration, was printed
  by the brothers Gregorio at Venice in 1492. And there are some
  illustrations in a book called '<span class="sc">Fiore di Virtù</span>,'
  which appeared in Venice in the same year, that may be praised for the
  work of the wood-engraver, though the designer shows a sad ignorance of
  the laws of perspective and proportion. And we have before us an
  illustration to a poem by <span class="sc">Poliziano</span>, in which
  Giuliano dei Medici is kneeling before the altar of the goddess Minerva,
  where we see graceful drawing by the artist and fairly good engraving. It
  <!-- Page 50 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page50"></a>{50}</span>was
  printed in Florence, but the type bears no comparison with the beauty of
  the Aldine books.</p>

  </div>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The love of colour, which is born in all Italians, led them to develop
  a process of making pictures in chiaroscuro&mdash;by printing several
  wood-blocks one upon another, each block giving a separate tint. In fact,
  it was the beginning of the modern colour-printing. The invention of the
  new process was claimed by Ugo da Carpi, who reproduced several of the
  designs of Raphael. In the beginning of the next century we find pictures
  printed in four different colours&mdash;trying to imitate water-colour,
  or, rather, distemper drawings. (See p. <a href="#page99">99</a>.)</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>At Lyons, about the same time, there was an illustrated edition of
  '<span class="sc">Terence</span>' published, with well-executed woodcuts,
  from which we are able to give only the frontispiece, 'The Author writing
  his book.' It is sufficient to show that the engraving is the work of a
  practised hand.</p>

<h5>CHAPTER VI</h5>

<h5><i>IN FRANCE IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY</i></h5>

  <p>Before we begin our brief history of wood-engraving in France it will
  be well to speak of the technical part of the new art in the fifteenth
  century. We have already stated that the engraving of the 'St.
  Christopher' and other large prints were cut with a knife on planks of
  apple or pear or other close-grained wood; but there has always been much
  doubt about the small book illustrations which appeared in various
  countries quite at the end of the century. The discovery, however, of
  some engraved blocks of metal solved the difficulty. In those days
  workers in metal were to be found in all large towns; the age of moulding
  and casting everything that could be cast had not then arrived: of
  course, coins and medals were made in the foundry; but handwork of the
  most perfect kind on metal was as common as wood-carving for the
  churches.</p>

  <p>Experts have discovered twisted lines in some of the old prints; a
  line in a woodcut may easily be broken but it can hardly be bent, and it
  is now asserted that many of the woodcuts, including the beautiful
  initial letters in Fust and Schoeffer's 'Psalter,' were really engraved
  on metal. The view of London at the head of the first page of the
  <i>Illustrated London News</i> is, we are told, cut in brass; Mulready's
  well-known envelope, engraved on brass by the celebrated wood-engraver,
  John Thompson, may be seen in the South Kensington Museum; and scores of
  other examples of metalwork of this kind might be cited.</p>

<p><!-- Page 52 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page52"></a>{52}</span></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:31%;">

    ORNAMENTS FROM 'HEURES A L'USAIGE DE CHARTRE'<br />
    (<i>Published by Vostre</i>)
  </div>

  <p>And there is no doubt that the famous illustrations of the Missal, or
  'Book of Hours,' issued in Paris between 1490 and 1520, were engraved on
  metal of some kind, perhaps on copper or some amalgam of tin and copper.
  There was a metal known as 'latten' in those days, and probably the
  engraving was done on some material of this kind, not too hard to cut,
  not too soft to wear away. It will be noticed that the groundwork of many
  borders in the French books is filled with little white dots,
  <i>criblé</i> it was called; these dots are, in the first place, to
  imitate similar work in the gold grounds of the borders of illustrated
  missals, and, in the second place, to save the labour of cutting away so
  much of the metal as would be required for a white ground. These dots
  were evidently <!-- Page 53 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page53"></a>{53}</span>made by means of a sharp and finely-pointed
  tool driven by a blow into the metal. (See page <a
  href="#page59">59</a>.)</p>

  <p>France was not early in the field with illustrated books, but she
  quickly made up for the delay by the excellence of her work, more
  especially in ornament. In 1488, Pierre Le Rouge, a printer and
  publisher, sent forth a book, '<span class="sc">La Mer des
  Histoires</span>,' which contains many charming designs, from which
  beautiful wall-papers we know of have been borrowed; they are as well
  engraved as similar work at the present day, and only needed better
  'over-laying' by the pressman, an art but little practised at that time.
  This book contains the first decorative work by wood-engraving we have
  met with, and shows the great excellence of art in France at this period.
  There is a good example, though much reduced in size, among the
  illustrations of Mr. William Morris's paper 'On the Woodcuts of Gothic
  Books,' that he read before a meeting of the Society of Arts in January
  1892: it is printed in the Journal of the Society for February 12th.</p>

  <p>Besides Le Rouge, there were in Paris at the end of the fifteenth and
  beginning of the sixteenth centuries four celebrated printers, who were
  also publishers, whose books command our attention. Their names are Simon
  Vostre, Antoine Verard, Thielman Kerver, a German, and Guyot Marchant;
  they all published the 'Book of Hours,' illustrated and decorated by the
  best artists and engravers of their time. There was likewise a printer
  named Philippe Pigouchet, who was also an engraver on wood, and who began
  by cutting blocks for Simon Vostre, and afterwards turned publisher on
  his own account. An important point to notice in connection with the
  illustrations of French 'Books of Hours' at this time is that they are
  nearly all inspired by German artists and nearly all copied from
  illuminated MSS.</p>

  </div>

<p><!-- Page 55 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page55"></a>{55}</span></p>

  <p>At the end of the fifteenth century the art of illumination was at its
  height in Paris. No one excelled the exquisite work of Jean Foucquet,
  servant to the King, and Jean Perreal, painter to Anne of Brittany.
  Manuscripts containing their miniature paintings command a large sum
  whenever they are offered for sale at the present day. These artists, it
  is said, gave their aid to the publishers of the 'Book of Hours'
  (<i>Heures à l'usage de Rome</i>), which had such an enormous sale that
  each publisher produced an edition for himself. Mr. Noel Humphreys
  asserts, in his 'History of the Art of Printing,' that no fewer than
  sixty editions were published between 1484 and 1494. In his 'Introduction
  to the Study and Collection of Ancient Prints,' Dr. Willshire says:
  'Towards the end of the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth
  centuries some well-known French printers&mdash;Pigouchet, Jean Dupré,
  Antoine Verard, and Simon Vostre&mdash;published some beautiful "Books of
  Hours," ornamented with engravings having some peculiar characters. The
  chief of these were that the ground and often the dark portions of the
  print were finely <i>criblé</i> or dotted white, serving as a means of
  "killing black"&mdash;a practice then prevalent among French engravers;
  secondly, each page of text was surrounded by a border of little subjects
  engraved in the same manner, and often repeated at every third page....
  Not unfrequently they were printed in brilliant ink on fine vellum, that
  they might compete with the illuminated MS. "Books of Hours" then in
  fashion. The prints decorating these books have been generally considered
  to be impressions from wood.' But Mr. Linton says they are from engraved
  blocks of metal; and every practical man will, we are sure, agree with
  the great living Master of Wood-engraving.</p>

  <p>Our first illustration is from a 'Book of Hours,' or Missal, published
  by Simon Vostre in 1488. It represents 'The Death of the Virgin,' a
  subject that was always chosen by the illustrator of religious books in
  those days; in our account of wood-engraving in the next two centuries we
  shall frequently meet with it among the works of the great artists. <!--

  </div>

<p><!-- Page 57 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page57"></a>{57}</span></p>

  <p>The Gothic framework of the cut is evidently borrowed from church
  ornament. The expression of the faces in the crowd of visitors is far in
  advance of anything we have seen hitherto in the German cuts; and the
  engraving, which was probably on metal, is evidently facsimile of the
  drawing and is remarkably well executed. The narrow border on the right
  of the cut is from an illuminated manuscript. In another of Vostre's
  Missals we find a copy of an engraving after the German painter, Martin
  Schongauer, 'Christ bearing the Cross,' enclosed in a French Renaissance
  frame. In the sky there is a good example of the <i>criblé</i> work of
  which we have spoken. The towers of Jerusalem in the background must have
  been evolved from the artist's inner consciousness: he certainly never
  saw the Holy City.</p>

  <p>Antoine Verard also published many 'Livres d'Heures,'<a name="NtA_5"
  href="#Nt_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> very much like Vostre's. We are told that
  he frequently printed a few copies on the finest vellum and had them
  coloured in exact imitation of the illuminated Missals. One of Verard's
  patrons was the Duc d'Angoulême, a noted bibliophile, who commissioned
  him to print on vellum the romance of '<span class="sc">Tristan</span>,'
  the 'Book of Consolation' of Boethius, the 'Ordinaire du Chrétien,' and
  the 'Heures en François,' all with illuminated borders and handsome
  bindings. For this great amount of work Verard received about
  240<i>l.</i>, then equivalent perhaps to 1,000<i>l.</i> of the present
  day. We give an outline copy of one of the pages of the romance of '<span
  class="sc">Tristan</span>,' which will repay much attention both for the
  principal subject, the King's Banquet, and the tapestry on the wall,
  which ought to be coloured to be properly appreciated. This famous
  publisher issued also a huge chronicle in five folio volumes, the 'Miroir
  Historical,' profusely illustrated with good wood engravings; the first
  volume in 1495, the last in 1496. <!-- Page 58 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page58"></a>{58}</span></p>

    (<i>From the romance of 'Tristan,' published by Antoine Verard</i>)
  </div>

  <p>Thielman Kerver, the German, also brought out many 'Books of Hours,'
  copying those issued by Simon Vostre in a most barefaced way; indeed,
  piracy of this kind was rampant all over Europe, and but little regarded.
  We give <!-- Page 59 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page59"></a>{59}</span>a reduced copy of Kerver's book-mark; in the
  original it will be seen that the background is <i>criblé</i>, thus
  suggesting that it was cut on metal.</p>

      alt="Mark of Thielman Kerver" title="Mark of Thielman Kerver" /></a>
    MARK OF THIELMAN KERVER
  </div>

  <p>It was Guyot Marchant who produced, in 1485, the first edition of the
  '<span class="sc">Dance of Death</span>,' which contained seventeen
  engravings on ten folio leaves, with the text printed in the old Gothic
  characters. This awe-inspiring but highly popular subject had been
  painted on the walls of many public buildings in Germany and France, and
  in past ages it had always been a great favourite with the lower classes
  (many of our readers will remember a version of it on the walls of the
  curious old wooden bridge at Lucerne, the designs of which have doubtless
  been handed down by tradition)&mdash;but <!-- Page 60 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page60"></a>{60}</span>Marchant was the first
  who printed the story in a series of woodcuts, well drawn and admirably
  engraved, and he had his reward, for the work was reprinted over and over
  again. The Pope, the Emperor, the Bishop, the Duke and the Duchess are
  given with much spirit, and are evidently the work of a clever
  draughtsman, who might, however, have made his Death a little less
  hideous. But there was a great love of the horrible in those days.</p>

  <p>A special chapter might well be devoted to the beautiful marks used by
  French printers. Guyot Marchant's mark represents leather-workers engaged
  at their trade, and above are a few musical notes. There are two
  varieties of this device. The mark of Jehan Du Pré is an elaborate piece
  of work, in which heraldry plays a conspicuous part, while that of
  Antoine Caillaut is pictorial. The Le Noirs used devices in which the
  heads of negroes figured prominently. The well-known mark of Badius
  Ascensius represents printers at work. Jehan Petit used several beautiful
  cuts, in which his mark forms part of an elaborate design.</p>

<h5>CHAPTER VII</h5>

<h5><i>IN ENGLAND IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY</i></h5>

  <p>In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries many of the finest churches
  in England were built by architects so celebrated that some of them were
  sent for to erect similar buildings in France. The beautiful carvings and
  highly decorated monuments still existing in our cathedrals prove that
  the art of sculpture in England was at that time little inferior to that
  of other countries. And in the British Museum and Bodleian Library, and
  many private collections, there is plentiful evidence that the miniature
  painters and illuminators were but little behind their brethren in Italy
  and France; even the binders, as we see by existing work, used excellent
  ornament in the decoration of the covers of their books. Why is it, then,
  that we find the art of wood-engraving, when it was flourishing in all
  the chief countries on the Continent, almost at its earliest state of
  infancy in England? This is a question very difficult to answer.
  Certainly our great printers, William Caxton, and his successors, Wynkyn
  de Worde and Richard Pynson, did not follow the example of the great
  typographers of Venice or the yet more-to-be-praised booksellers of
  Paris, who devoted so much energy and taste in the decoration of their
  books.</p>

  <p>Of the few cuts printed in the fifteenth century, such as they are, we
  must say a few words. The earliest are all <!-- Page 62 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page62"></a>{62}</span>small devotional
  pictures, representing Scriptural subjects, as 'The Image of Pity,' a
  figure of Christ on the Cross surrounded by emblems of the Passion; four
  or five only of these early cuts have been found.</p>

  <p>William Caxton, the first English printer, who was born in the Weald
  of Kent about the year 1422, was apprenticed to Robert Large, a rich
  mercer of London, who was Lord Mayor in 1440. In the following year the
  master died and Caxton went to Bruges, where he prospered in business,
  and in 1462 was made Governor of a Company of English Merchants who
  traded in Flanders, then the foremost mercantile country in the world. In
  1471 Caxton gave up commerce and attached himself to the court of
  Margaret, Duchess of Burgundy, the sister of Edward IV. At the request of
  the duchess, he then translated the <i>Le Recueil des Histoires de
  Troye</i>, written by Raoul Lefevre, and employed Colard Mansion of
  Bruges to produce it. This was the first book printed in the English
  language. In passing his book through the press Caxton learned the new
  art, and with type bought of Colard Mansion he set up the first
  printing-press in England, at the sign of 'The Red Pale' in the Almonry
  at Westminster, at the end of the year 1476. 'The Dictes and Sayings of
  Philosophers,' which appeared in 1477, is believed to be the first book
  printed in England; this was followed by 'The Morale Prouerbes of
  Cristyne,' and several other books, all without illustration. In 1478 he
  printed 'The Mirrour of the World,' the first book printed in England
  with cuts, one of which we give as an example; and the more famous 'Game
  and Playe of the Chesse,' from the second edition of which we have taken
  as a specimen 'The Knight,' which Caxton thus describes: 'The knyght
  ought to be maad al armed upon a hors in such wise that he have an helme
  on his heed and a spere in his right hond, and coverid with his shelde, a
  swerde and a mace on his left syde, clad with an halberke and plates
  tofore his breste, legge harnoys on his legges, spores on his heelis, on
  hys handes hys gauntelettes, hys hors wel broken and taught, and apte to

  perfect copy was bought for the enormous sum of 1,950<i>l.</i> In 1483
  appeared 'The Golden Legende,' considered to be his <i>magnum opus</i>,

  class="pagenum"><a name="page64"></a>{64}</span>said that Caxton printed
  ninety-nine different works, of which sixty-four survive either in
  perfect books or in fragments, which may be consulted at the British
  Museum. He produced the first printed edition of Chaucer, Lydgate, Gower,
  and Sir Thomas Malory's 'King Arthur.' He was an accomplished linguist,
  and translated and published Cicero's Orations 'De Senectute' and 'De
  Amicitia,' Virgil's 'Æneid' and many other classical works.</p>

  <p>With one exception none of his books has a title-page, though some

  all printed in the Gothic <!-- Page 65 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  nearly all are in small folio size. Caxton, we are assured, received the
  patronage and friendship of all the great men of his time and was much
  esteemed throughout Europe; and from a miniature painting in a beautiful
  manuscript in the library of Lambeth Palace we know that Earl Rivers
  presented him with his first book in his hand to the King, Edward IV. It
  is supposed that he died at the end of 1491 in his sixty-ninth year.</p>

    WYNKYN DE WORDE'S MARK<br />
    <i>With Caxton's Initials</i>
  </div>

  <p>Wynkyn de Worde, Caxton's pupil and successor, was a native of
  Lorraine. He probably came over with him from Bruges, and so attached was
  he to his master, and so highly did he esteem him, that in all the nine
  book-marks that De Worde used, he always included the initials W. C. The
  mark we have given is of rare occurrence, and is one of the best pieces
  of engraving of the time. Bibliographers have found four hundred books
  printed by him; among them is 'The Golden Legende,' with woodcuts (1493);
  a translation of 'Huon de Bordeaux,' from which Shakespeare borrowed the
  plot of his 'Midsummer Night's Dream'; and his best-known <!-- Page 66
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page66"></a>{66}</span>work, often
  reprinted, 'Treatyses perteynynge to Hawkynge and Huntynge, and Fyshynge
  with an Angle,' by Dame Juliana Berners (1496), which contains many
  woodcuts, one of which, a man fishing, is very quaint (<i>see
  engraving</i>). A book which was 'imprynted at London in Flete Street in
  1531,' called 'Pilgrymage of Perfeccyon, A devoute Treatyse in
  Englysshe,' is illustrated by three curiously folded woodcuts. De Worde
  was the first printer in England who used the Roman type. Several of his
  books have a woodcut on the title-page.</p>

  <p>In his 'History of Wood-engraving,' Mr. Chatto gives his opinion about
  the cuts of this period:&mdash;'Although I am inclined to believe that
  within the fifteenth century there were no persons who practised
  wood-engraving in this country as a distinct profession, yet it by no
  means follows from such an admission that Caxton's and De Worde's cuts
  must have been engraved by foreign artists. The manner in which they are
  executed is so coarse that they might have been cut by any person who
  could handle a graver. Looking at them merely as specimens of
  wood-engraving, they are not generally superior to the practice-blocks
  cut by a modern wood-engraver's apprentice within the first month of his
  novitiate.'</p>

  <p>Soon there were other printers in London. Richard Pynson began to
  publish books from his own press in Fleet Street. His first book
  illustrated with woodcuts appears to have been 'The Canterbury Tales,'
  printed before 1493. In the following year Pynson issued Lydgate's 'Falle
  of Princis' with numerous small woodcuts by a master-hand, which appear
  too good to be English.</p>

  <p>For a 'Sarum Missal' of 1500, he used some beautifully engraved
  borders and ornaments, as well as a large cut of Archbishop Morton's coat
  of arms. Another of his important works was Lord Berners' translation of
  Syr John Froissart's 'Cronycles of Englande, Fraunce, Spayne, &amp;c.' We
  give a <!-- Page 68 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  this and De Worde's were engraved on the Continent.</p>

  <p>In 1498, Julian Notary established an office from which twenty-three
  books have been traced. Many of them have curious woodcuts, some of which
  seem to have descended to him from Caxton and Wynkyn de Worde. We find
  the decoration of the covers of Notary's works mentioned with approval in
  the early history of book-binding, which arrived at a much greater
  perfection than wood-engraving in this country at the close of the
  fifteenth century.</p>

<h5>CHAPTER VIII</h5>

<h5><i>IN GERMANY IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY</i></h5>

  <p>We must now retrace our brief history to Germany, where, under the
  immediate direction and control of such well-known artists as Albrecht
  Dürer of Nürnberg (<i>b.</i> 1471, <i>d.</i> 1528) and Hans Burgkmair of
  Augsburg (<i>b.</i> 1472, <i>d.</i> 1531), as well as of Lucas Cranach, a
  Franconian (<i>b.</i> 1472, <i>d.</i> 1553), and, afterwards, of Hans
  Holbein of Augsburg (<i>b.</i> 1497, <i>d.</i> 1543), the art of
  wood-engraving in its grandest and purest form arrived at its first
  culmination. This was in a great measure due to the liberal patronage of
  the Emperor Maximilian, who, possessing a great love of art, esteemed all
  painters, architects, designers, and engravers as highly as his warriors.
  He was fond of magnificence in a truly imperial way, and the superb
  series of wood-engravings&mdash;the noblest the world has ever
  seen&mdash;known as 'The Triumphs of Maximilian,' were the outcome of
  this generous tendency. Of these celebrated works, which were not
  completed when the Emperor died in 1519, we must speak in their proper
  place.</p>

  <p>It was to the genius of Albrecht Dürer and the engravers who
  translated his drawings into woodcuts that the art received its new
  vigour. Up to this time wood-engraving in Germany had been the work of
  craftsmen who were little better than mechanics; but when Dürer and
  Burgkmair, who knew the capabilities of the art, made drawings on the
  wood expressly for the engravers to reproduce in exact lines, there <!--
  Page 70 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page70"></a>{70}</span>was a
  quick improvement which went on increasing in excellence for more than
  half a century. After the death of Holbein and his immediate successors,
  the art faded into insignificance in Germany for many years.</p>

  <p>The first important work of the early life of Albrecht Dürer was a
  series of fifteen large drawings on wood representing allegorical Scenes
  from the Apocalypse. They are mystical, indeed almost incomprehensible;
  at the same time we are obliged to notice the tremendous vigour and the
  wonderful power of invention in the man who designed them. But his
  attempt to embody the supernatural led him into the most extravagant
  conceptions. 'In attempting to bring such themes within the power of
  expression which art possesses,' writes Mr. Woodbery, 'he strove to give
  speech to the unutterable.' Yet the genius of the true artist was
  apparent through all his work. The most celebrated of the Apocalypse
  designs is the fourth in the book, 'The Opening of the First Four Seals,'
  a wonderfully grand conception of the Four Horsemen going forth to
  conquer; Death on the pale horse below, and 'Hell following him.'
  (Revelation vi. 8.) King, burgher, peasant and priest, have all fallen
  beneath him. Although we are expressly told that Dürer himself printed
  this work in 1498, it by no means follows that he engraved the woodcuts;
  they are greatly in advance of any previous work of the kind, and this
  may be attributed to the fact that the artist who designed them knew the
  best capabilities of the art. If he and the unknown engraver had learned
  the advantages of lowering the face of the wood when delicate lines were
  required, and the present methods of overlaying the cuts to produce
  greater intensity of colour, some of the engravings of Dürer's time would
  be models of excellence.</p>

  <p>The series of the Apocalypse was succeeded by three others in which
  the human interest is far greater. These were what the artist himself
  called 'The Larger Passion of <!-- Page 71 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page71"></a>{71}</span>Our Lord,' a series of eleven large cuts,
  with a vignette on the title-page; 'The Life of the Virgin,' a series of
  twenty cuts; and 'The Smaller Passion of Our Lord,' a series of
  thirty-six cuts of less size, with a well-known vignette of 'Christ
  Mocked' on the title-page. These works mark an important era in the
  history of wood-engraving and clearly led onwards to its future
  development. They were all published between 1510 and 1512, and so great
  was their popularity that the celebrated Italian engraver, Marc Antonio
  Raimondi, reproduced the whole of 'The Smaller Passion' in
  copper-plate&mdash;much, as may be imagined, to Dürer's annoyance.</p>

  <p>In the 'Larger Passion of Our Lord' we find representations of the
  Last Supper, Christ on the Mount of Olives, the Betrayal, the Scourging,
  Christ Mocked, Christ Bearing his Cross, the Crucifixion, the
  Resurrection, and other subjects from the New Testament; and so deeply
  did the highly-wrought artist feel the awful importance of his subject
  that he repeated some of these events in at least five different series.
  In all of them his characters are dressed in the uncouth habiliments of
  German peasants, and we see bits of German villages; but in this respect
  he only followed the example of the great Italian painters, who clothed
  the most sacred figures in the costumes of their own towns, and, when
  possible, gave an Italian landscape for a background to their pictures of
  the Holy Land.</p>

  <p>The series of twenty large engravings called 'The Life of the Virgin'
  was published and sold by Dürer himself in book form at about the same
  time (1510), and was equally well received by the German people, who were
  at that time in a state of religious ferment consequent on the preachings
  of Martin Luther, and Dürer was one of his prominent disciples.</p>

    <i>Engraved by Jerome Andre</i> (<i>?</i>)
  </div>

<p><!-- Page 73 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page73"></a>{73}</span></p>

  <p>But it was the series of thirty-seven smaller woodcuts, known as 'The
  Lesser Passion,' that was most popular; in some measure, perhaps, because
  the prints are of a more handy size. All the subjects of 'The Larger
  Passion' are repeated, with variations, in this series, and twenty-five
  others from the Life of Christ are added. By a happy chance, thirty-five
  of the original woodcuts of this series are preserved in the British
  Museum. In the year 1840 they were reprinted, by permission of the
  trustees, under the care of Mr. Henry Cole. The wood was found to be much
  worm-eaten, but all injury was deftly repaired by Mr. Thurston Thompson,
  and a small edition of the work was issued<a name="NtA_6"
  href="#Nt_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> with an exhaustive introduction by Mr.
  Cole.</p>

  <p>The most admired of all the works of Dürer are the large plates known
  as 'The Knight, Death, and the Devil,' 'The Conversion of St. Eustace,'
  'Melencolia,' 'St. Jerome in his Chamber,' and several others which he
  engraved or etched on copper with his own hands and which he himself
  published. Fine impressions of these marvellous works are now as eagerly
  sought for as celebrated Rembrandt etchings.</p>

  <p>Dürer made also many drawings on wood which were engraved and printed
  under his immediate supervision, and issued in separate sheets. Of one of
  the most beautiful, of these, 'The Virgin crowned by two Angels,' we are
  able to give an impression which is an exact facsimile (reduced) of a
  print of the year 1518. Nothing of its kind can exceed the brilliancy of
  the original, the engraving is as nearly perfect as possible, and were it
  not for the hardness of the lines in the faces and other objects where
  softness is required, no craftsman of the present day could surpass its
  excellence as a product of the printing-press. Many other separate large
  wood-engravings, after Dürer's drawings, appeared between the years 1510
  and 1518, such as 'The Holy Family with the three Rabbits,' 'St. Jerome
  in his Chamber,' 'The Flight into Egypt,' 'Beheading of St. John the
  Baptist,' and, among other strange subjects, a representation of a
  Rhinoceros. <!-- Page 74 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page74"></a>{74}</span>Dürer also designed a frontispiece to his
  own book of poems, published in 1510.</p>

  <p>Three magnificent books illustrated with woodcuts of great size, the
  'Theuerdank,' the 'Werskunig,' and the 'Freydal,' appeared in Germany
  early in the sixteenth century. The first is an epic relating to the
  Emperor Maximilian's journey to Burgundy on matrimonial affairs; it was
  published in 1517. Hans Schaufelein drew the designs for a hundred and
  eighteen cuts, measuring 6½ inches by 5½ inches each. The second is in
  honour of the Emperor's journeys in distant lands, and the third to
  celebrate his deeds of prowess. There are 237 designs, chiefly by Hans
  Burgkmair of Augsburg, in the 'Werskunig'; the blocks are still
  preserved; they remained unused till long after the Emperor's death, and
  were not published till 1775. The 'Freydal' has never been completed,
  though the designs are still in existence.</p>

<h5><i>THE TRIUMPHS OF MAXIMILIAN</i></h5>

  <p>But we have yet to speak of 'The Triumphs of Maximilian.' This
  imperial work, the most important production of the art of wood-engraving
  the world has ever seen, was executed by command of the Emperor
  Maximilian to convey to posterity a pictorial representation of the
  magnificence of his court, the splendour of his victories, and the extent
  of his dominions. It consists of three distinct sets of designs: (I.) The
  'Triumphal Arch,' (II.) the 'Triumphal Car,' both from the hand of
  Albrecht Dürer, and (III.) the 'Triumphal Procession,' by Hans Burgkmair.
  The size of the work is immense; if the whole series were laid out side
  by side it would cover about one hundred and ninety-two feet (64 yards!)
  The drawings were made on pear-wood and were cut by about eleven
  different engravers, of whom the most famous was Jerome of Nürnberg. Many
  of the original blocks are happily preserved in the Imperial Library at
  Vienna, and on the backs of them are written the names or <!-- Page 75
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page75"></a>{75}</span>initials of the
  various engravers. It is evident, therefore, that at the beginning of the
  sixteenth century there was a recognised school of wood-engravers in
  Germany of considerable importance. One of them, Jobst de Neger, or
  Dienecker, came from Antwerp; a few lived at Nürnberg, others at
  Augsburg.</p>

  <p>Some idea of the 'Triumphal Arch' is conveyed to our mind when we
  learn that it was drawn on ninety-two separate blocks of wood, and that
  when properly joined it is ten and a half feet high and nine and a half
  feet wide! It was designed 'after the manner of those erected in honour
  of the Roman Emperors at Rome;' there are three gateways or
  entrances&mdash;that in the centre is called the Gate of Honour and
  Power, on the right is the Gate of Nobility, on the left the Gate of
  Fame, a part of which is seen in the illustration. The arch itself is
  decorated with portraits of the Roman Emperors from the time of Julius
  Cæsar, shields of arms showing the descent of the Emperor and his
  alliances, representations of his most famous exploits, including his
  adventures while chamois-hunting in the Tyrol, with explanatory verses in
  the German language cut in the wood. Above the central entrance is a
  grand tower surmounted by a figure of Fortune holding the imperial crown.
  The whole is a kind of epitome of the history of the German Empire. The
  'projector of the design' was Hans Stabius, who calls himself the
  historiographer and poet of the Emperor. The work was begun in
  1515&mdash;four years before the Emperor's death&mdash;and was not quite
  finished at the time of the death of the artist in 1528. Although we do
  not see the greatest excellence of Dürer's peculiar genius in this
  immense production executed to order, for it is too full of German
  fantasies and very unlike the classic simplicity of the old Roman arches,
  it will be found to contain the finest work of the wood-engraver at that
  period. Some parts of it are of a marvellous delicacy that can hardly be
  surpassed. <!-- Page 76 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  </div>

<p><!-- Page 77 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page77"></a>{77}</span></p>

  <p>The 'Triumphal Car,' also designed by Dürer at the suggestion of
  Stabius, is a richly decorated chariot drawn by six pairs of horses. In
  it the Emperor in his imperial robes is seated under a canopy amid
  allegorical figures representing Justice, Truth, Clemency, Temperance,
  and the like, who offer to him triumphal wreaths. Over the canopy is an
  inscription: <b>quod . in . celis . sol . Hoc . in . terra . Caesar .
  est.</b> The Car is driven by Reason with Reins of Nobility and Power,
  and the horses are guided by female figures of Swiftness, Prudence,
  Boldness, and similar equine virtues. The whole of the design is seven
  feet four inches in length and about a foot and a half in height.</p>

  <p>To modern eyes the car is not prepossessing, the figures of the
  attendant damsels are by no means elegant, and the horses would not, we
  fear, meet with the approval of English critics. It brings to us a
  reminiscence of the funeral car of the Duke of Wellington, which, we
  remember, was designed by a German artist. Some parts of the decorations
  are excellent and the whole is well engraved.</p>

  <p>The 'Triumphal Procession' is still more important. It consists of a
  series of one hundred and thirty-five large cuts, which, joined together,
  would cover in length one hundred and seventy-five feet (upwards of 58
  yards!) A herald, mounted on a fantastic, four-footed winged gryphon,
  leads the procession; next follow two led horses bearing a tablet with
  these words, doubtless by Stabius: 'This Triumph has been made for the
  praise and everlasting memory of the noble pleasures and glorious
  victories of the most serene and illustrious prince and lord, Maximilian,
  Roman Emperor elect, and head of Christendom, King and Heir of seven
  Christian kingdoms, Archduke of Austria, Duke of Burgundy and of other
  grand principalities and provinces of Europe.' More horses follow, then
  come falconers with hawks on their wrists, hunters of the chamois and the
  bear, behind them are elks and buffaloes, richly caparisoned stags four
  abreast, and camels drawing decorated chariots in which ride the
  musicians.</p>

  with banners inscribed with the names of the great battles which the
  Emperor had won, cars filled with trophies taken from conquered nations,
  among them the 'Savages of Calicut'&mdash;natives of India&mdash;one of
  them riding a huge elephant, and numerous other figures filled up the
  immense length of the engraving. <!-- Page 79 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  </div>

  <p>The whole work, though evidently intended to be a glorification of the
  great Emperor, is much <!-- Page 80 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page80"></a>{80}</span>more valuable to us at the present day as a
  marvellous record of the barbaric magnificence of the middle ages, and an
  outward aspect of secular life. 'The ideal of worldly power and
  splendour, the spirit of pleasure and festival, is shown forth in this
  marvellously varied march of laurelled horses and horsemen, whose
  trappings and armour have the beauty and glitter of peaceful parade.
  There is nowhere else a work which so presents at once the feudal spirit
  and feudal delights in such exuberance of picturesque and feudal
  display.'</p>

  <p>Dürer's designs for the 'Prayer-book of Maximilian' also claim a short
  notice. Only three copies of the work are known to be in existence, one
  of which is in the British Museum. The margins are full of fanciful
  designs; amid intertwining branches, birds are singing, apes are
  climbing, snakes creeping, and gnats flying. King David is charming a
  stork with his harp; a fox is playing a flute to poultry. It is a curious
  mixture of the sacred and profane, for which Dürer has often been
  censured. The engraving of the subjects, which are in outline, is
  excellent.</p>

<h5>CHAPTER IX</h5>

<h5><i>HANS HOLBEIN AND HANS LÜTZELBURGER</i></h5>

  <p>Hans Holbein, who first saw the light at Augsburg in the year 1497,
  was the greatest artist ever born in Germany, and as he passed half of
  his artistic life in England we may claim some little share in the glory
  of his undisputed eminence.</p>

  <p>The son of a worthy painter of sacred pictures for the Church, he was
  brought up amidst all the paraphernalia of the studio, and at a very
  early age began to design title-pages, initial letters, and ornaments for
  numerous important books published by Johann Froben, Valentine Curio, and
  other printers of Basel, and Christoph Froschover, of Zürich. Some of
  these folio title-pages, most of which are of an architectural character,
  are veritable works of art, and are greatly treasured at the present day.
  Next we find him making illustrations for the New Testament, some of
  which were engraved on wood and some on metal, probably by Dienecker or
  Lützelburger, though of this we have no direct evidence.</p>

  <p>But Holbein's greatest fame, as a designer of book-illustrations, is
  derived from his well-known series of the 'Dance of Death,' which was
  first given to the world in the year 1538, though from some proofs still
  in existence they are known to have been engraved before the artist's
  first visit to London in 1527. It is believed that the original forty-one
  drawings on wood were all cut by Hans Lützelburger, who has been very
  properly called the 'True Prince of Wood-Engravers,' for, in the opinion
  of our foremost critics, these 'Dance of Death' cuts are the masterpieces
  of the art at that period, excelling even the work of Jerome Andre of
  Nürnberg on Dürer's 'Triumphal Arch.' <!-- Page 82 --><span

  <p>Seventeen other designs were added to the 'Dance of Death' afterwards,
  making the complete series fifty-eight. The original blocks are lost;
  they have been copied on the Continent many times, and were reproduced in
  England in perfect facsimile and in the very best manner under the
  superintending care of Francis Douce, a celebrated antiquary, by John and
  Mary Byfield and George Bonner, all excellent engravers. Accompanied by a
  learned dissertation by Mr. Douce, the work <!-- Page 83 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page83"></a>{83}</span>was published by William
  Pickering<a name="NtA_7" href="#Nt_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> in the year
  1833. It is from electrotypes of these blocks that we are enabled to
  present to our readers the designs of 'The King,' 'The Queen,' 'The
  Astrologer,' and 'The Pedlar,' four of the best of the series.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Wall-pictures of 'The Dance of Death,' with but little artistic merit,
  existed at a much earlier period, and some of them may still be traced in
  the cloisters of old cathedrals. The subject was a great favourite with
  both priest and people in the Middle Ages; it appealed to the feelings of
  rich and poor, old and young, and Holbein's 'fearful' pictures, as soon
  as they appeared, met with immense popularity, which, to this day, has
  never ceased. <!-- Page 84 --><span class="pagenum"><a

    HOLBEIN'S DANCE OF DEATH<br />
    THE ASTROLOGER
  </div>

  <p>Almost every class is represented in them&mdash;the King at his
  well-spread board is served by his fellow King, who fills his bowl; the
  Queen, walking with her ladies, is led into an open grave; in a
  landscape, in which we see a flock of sheep, Death appears to an aged
  Bishop; here we see Death running away with the Abbot's mitre and
  crozier; there he visits the Physician and the Astrologer. In the church
  is a Preacher who holds the people in awe, behind him is a Preacher more
  dread still; the Miser with his bags, the Merchant with his bales, are
  alike surprised by Death; the Knight's armour is defenceless, the Pedlar
  with his basket cannot escape, the Waggoner with <!-- Page 85 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page85"></a>{85}</span>his wine-cart is
  overthrown. All are represented in their turn&mdash;the Duchess in her
  bed, the poor woman in her hovel, the child who is ruthlessly taken from
  his mother. We can imagine the sensation which such a work would create
  among a very impressionable people at that season of religious ferment,
  the greatest the world has ever known. Thirteen editions from the
  original blocks are known to have been printed between the years 1538 and
  1563.</p>

  <p>About the same time another series of wood-engravings appeared,
  consisting of eighty-six designs by Holbein, drawn on wood larger than
  the 'Dance of Death' blocks and just as well engraved, probably by
  Lützelburger; these were 'Scenes from Old Testament History,' generally
  known as 'Holbein's Bible Cuts'; they were issued separately with
  descriptions in verse and were also used to illustrate Bibles. <!-- Page

    THE HAPPINESS OF THE GODLY.&mdash;HOLBEIN'S BIBLE CUTS<br />

  </div>

  <p>This series was also reproduced by the same artists who cut the 'Dance
  of Death,' under the superintendence of Mr. Douce; and it is from
  electrotypes of these blocks that we are enabled to give our two Bible
  illustrations, 'The Happiness of the Godly' (Psalm i.), and 'Joab's
  Artifice' (2 Samuel xiv. 4). They copy the original prints in exact
  facsimile, and, looking at them, one cannot but wonder at the high state
  of perfection to which the art of wood-engraving had attained nearly four
  hundred years ago. At that time, Germany stood alone in its excellence;
  France, and even Italy, were far behind her; and England and Spain were
  nowhere. We ought to add that both the 'Dance of Death' and the 'Bible
  Cuts' were <!-- Page 87 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page87"></a>{87}</span>issued, with text, by the brothers Trechsel,
  the celebrated publishers of Lyons, in 1538, when Holbein must have been
  in England.</p>

  <p>A wonderful alphabet, with 'Dance of Death' figures, evidently
  designed by Holbein, has <b>Hanns Lützelburger (Formschnider) genant
  Franck</b> printed at the foot of the page. These letters were probably
  engraved on metal. A 'Peasant's Dance' and 'Children's Sports,' designed
  as headings of chapters by the same artist, are well known, as they have
  been frequently reproduced.</p>

  </div>

  <p>In the works of 'The Little Masters' who succeeded Dürer and Holbein
  we are not much concerned. Albrecht Altdorfer (<i>d.</i> 1538) was a
  designer as well as an engraver on wood. Hans Beham (<i>d.</i> 1550?) is
  best known by his <!-- Page 88 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page88"></a>{88}</span>twentysix designs from the Apocalypse which
  Mr. Linton praises as of 'supremest excellence.' He says, moreover, that
  they were probably engraved on metal (perhaps copper), by Beham himself,
  as well as his 81 little Bible cuts which were used to illustrate the
  first English Bible. He also designed and perhaps engraved several large
  cuts, one of which, 'The Fountain of Youth,' is four feet long; another
  is 'The Dance of the Daughter of Herodias,' reproduced by Dr. Lippmann.
  Hans Brosamer (<i>d.</i> 1552) designed and engraved pictures for books.
  Heinrich Aldegrever (<i>d.</i> 1558) is well known for his portraits of
  Luther, Melanchthon, and the notorious John of Leyden. Virgil Solis
  (<i>d.</i> 1562) was a prolific book-illustrator; he designed a series of
  216 Bible pictures, all of small size, as well as 178 cuts for Ovid's
  'Metamorphoses,' and 194 for Æsop's Fables; he also designed and probably
  engraved much ornament, especially for title-pages of books, some of
  which was very good. Jost Amman (<i>d.</i> 1591) is celebrated for his
  book of 'All Ranks, Arts, and Trades,' with one hundred and thirty-two
  figures. (See page <a href="#page128">128</a>).</p>

  <p>The religious books printed in Germany at the end of the sixteenth
  century were altogether inferior as regards their illustrations, though a
  few are fairly designed and executed. Ornamental borders, especially on
  title pages, were usual, and those designed by Lucas Cranach are of
  considerable merit. Many of the German printers' marks or devices, which
  are very well engraved, were the work of some of the best artists of the
  times.</p>

  <p>These were but expiring efforts, and by the end of the century, owing
  to continual warfare and internal disturbances, the art of wood-engraving
  in Germany was almost forgotten.</p>

<h5>CHAPTER X</h5>

<h5><i>IN ITALY AND FRANCE IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY</i></h5>

  <p>In the early years of the sixteenth century, the printers of Florence
  issued many cheap popular books, chiefly <i>Rappresentazioni</i>, i.e.
  Plays, sacred or secular. These plays are generally badly printed in
  double columns, but they are illustrated with numerous cuts, some of
  which are of peculiar merit. The earliest known printer of them was
  Francesco Benvenuto (c. 1516-1545), but the majority appear to have been
  issued between 1550 and 1580, anonymously, though we know that Giovanni
  Baleni of Florence was the printer of some of these.</p>

  <p>There were also many quaint little tracts, metrical <i>Novelle</i> and
  <i>Istorie</i>, of which a collection has been found at the University
  Library, Erlangen; a valuable description of them was published by Dr.
  Varnhagen. The poems are, as a rule, illustrated with small cuts,
  inclosed within a neat border, the subjects are usually well chosen, and
  the drawing very good; the treatment of some of the domestic scenes is
  worthy of Bewick.</p>

    LE POT-CASSÉ<br />
    (<i>Device of Geoffroy Tory</i>)
  </div>

  <p>In striking contrast to the simplicity of these popular
  wood-engravings are the elaborate engravings which appeared in the more
  expensive books issued in the latter half of the same century, when
  illustrated editions of Dante, Boccaccio, Ovid, Æsop's Fables, and
  Alciat's 'Emblems,' appeared, one after the other, but not one of these
  calls for <!-- Page 91 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page91"></a>{91}</span>special notice; nor did the best of their
  wood-engravings equal the work of Lützelburger. The frontispiece of a
  curious book, <i>Le Sorti di Marcolini da Forli</i>, printed at Venice in
  1540, of which we offer a reduced copy, gives us a good idea of the
  prevailing art of the period. It is said to be taken from a design by
  Raphael for his celebrated picture 'The School of Athens,' and we see by
  the tablet in the foreground that it was either drawn on the wood or
  engraved by Joseph (Giuseppe) Porta, known as Salviati, after his more
  celebrated master whom he accompanied to Venice.</p>

  <p>In Paris, in the first half of the sixteenth century, there lived a
  very celebrated printer, 'Geoffroy Tory, Peintre et Graveur, Premier
  Imprimeur Royal, Reformateur de l'Orthographe, et de la Typographie,' as
  he is described by his biographer, M. A. Bernard (Paris, 1857). He was
  born at Bourges in 1480, and in early life went to Paris, where he not
  only wrote books and printed them, but designed ornamental borders and
  engraved them. He also studied his profession in Italy, and brought back
  with him new ideas about printing and illustrating books. Such a man had
  great influence at that time, for he had much inborn taste and excellent
  skill, and publishers should all be proud of him as one of their most
  praiseworthy ancestors. He adopted the singular design the
  <i>Pot-cassé</i>, of which we give a copy, as his somewhat enigmatical
  device; and some writers maintain that the little 'Cross of Lorraine'
  (&Dagger;) found on many of the cuts of this period is also his mark.
  <!-- Page 92 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page92"></a>{92}</span></p>

    <i>Engraved by Geoffroy Tory</i>
  </div>

<p><!-- Page 93 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page93"></a>{93}</span></p>

  <p>In our illustration, taken from the <i>Heures</i>, printed by Simon de
  Colines, this Cross of Lorraine will be seen under the kneeling priest.
  He made antique letters, he himself tells us, for Monseigneur the
  Treasurer for War, Master Jehan Grolier, whom we know as one of the best
  patrons of book-binding; and wrote a book which he called
  '<i>Champfleury, auquel est contenu l'art et science de la deue
  proportion des lettres ... selon le corps et le visage humain</i>,' a
  very learned and amusing treatise. Some of the initial letters in this
  book are very cleverly designed and engraved&mdash;probably by the
  ingenious author. The picture of 'Antoine Macault reading his translation
  of Diodorus Siculus to the King' is said to have been engraved by Tory;
  it is evidently either from a design by Hans Holbein or by an artist who
  copied his style. All the figures in this excellent engraving are
  portraits&mdash;the King (Francis I.), his three sons, and his favourite
  nobles. It is the best cut that was issued at Paris at this time.
  Geoffroy Tory died in 1533, though his workshop was carried on for many
  years afterwards.</p>

  <p>Among other woodcuts of this period we find a small portrait of the
  poet Nicholas Bourbon, dated 1535. As this is a direct copy of the
  portrait of the same individual, undoubtedly by Holbein, which is now at
  Windsor Castle, and as the ornamentation is quite in Holbein's style, we
  cannot doubt that this celebrated painter had frequent relations with the
  publishers on the Continent in the first half of the sixteenth
  century.</p>

  </div>

<p><!-- Page 95 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page95"></a>{95}</span></p>

  <p>Another celebrated printer who enjoyed the patronage of the King was
  Robert Estienne, who, by some curious perversity, is frequently spoken of
  by English scholars and biographers as Robert Stephens, simply because,
  following the fashion of the day, he often latinised his name and signed
  Robertus Stephanus. Estienne was, next to Aldo Manuzio of Venice, the
  most learned of printers, and deserves to be held in due reverence. The
  most important illustrated book he published was 'The Lives of the Dukes
  of Milan,' by Paulus Jovius (Paris, 1549). This work has sixteen
  portraits of the Dukes, well engraved, some say by Geoffroy Tory himself,
  but this is a matter of dispute, though they certainly were cut in his
  workshop.</p>

  <p>Among the most characteristic works of the wood-engraver in the middle
  of the century were two large processions, 'The Triumphal Entry of King
  Henri II. into Paris,' published by Roville of Lyons, in 1548, and 'The
  Triumphal Entry into Lyons,' issued in the following year. These prints
  were designed either by Jean Cousin or Cornelis de la Haye, but the name
  of the engraver is nowhere mentioned. They are somewhat similar to 'The
  Triumph of Maximilian,' by Burgkmair, but are not nearly so important as
  works of art, and did nothing to raise the character of
  wood-engraving.</p>

  <p>In the books published in the second half of the century we frequently
  meet with the name of Bernhard Salomon (born at Lyons in 1512), generally
  called Le Petit Bernard, who made designs for Alciat's 'Emblems' (<span
  class="sm">A.D.</span> 1560) and Ovid's 'Metamorphoses' (<span
  class="sm">A.D.</span> 1564), which were engraved in the workshop of
  Geoffroy Tory, and published by Jean (or Hans) de Tournes, of Lyons.
  Bernard's style was much influenced by the Italian painters Rosso and
  Primaticcio, who had been invited by the King to decorate Fontainebleau,
  and may be easily recognised by the extreme height and tenuity of his
  figures, and by the peculiar ornament which he used as framework for his
  drawings.</p>

  <p>Another book containing equally good illustrations is <i>Ghesneden
  Figuera wyten Niewen Testamente</i> ('Engraved Figures from the New
  Testament'), adorned with ninety-two small cuts besides the title-page
  and initial letters; these were drawn and probably engraved by Guilliame
  Borluyt, <!-- Page 96 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page96"></a>{96}</span>citizen of Ghent, and published by Jean de
  Tournes of Lyons in 1557. From the fineness of the lines and other
  indications we suspect these designs were cut on metal, which was much
  used at this time instead of wood. Through the kindness of Messrs. H. S.
  Nichols &amp; Co., of Soho Square, who possess an excellent copy of this
  very rare book, we are enabled to offer our readers two cuts, 'The Woman
  of Samaria' and 'Christ Scourged,' of the same size as the originals. The
  publishers of Lyons were celebrated from the end of the fourteenth to the
  middle of the fifteenth century for their dainty little books, which were
  very prettily illustrated.</p>

  </div>

  <p>We must not conclude this chapter without mentioning another
  celebrated publisher, Christophe Plantin of Antwerp. He was born at
  Saint-Avertin, near Tours, in 1514, and at an early age apprenticed to a
  printer and book-binder, Robert Macé, at Caen; thence he went to Paris,
  whence wars soon drove him away. He next took refuge at Antwerp, where he
  employed himself in binding books and making leather boxes,
  <i>coffrets</i>, curiously inlaid and gilt. <!-- Page 97 --><span

    THE SCOURGING OF CHRIST<br />
    <i>By Guilliame Borluyt</i>
  </div>

  <p>By mistake he was, one dark evening, stabbed with a sword, and he
  afterwards suffered so much pain from the wound that he could not stoop
  without feeling it: consequently he turned to the business of a printer,
  and soon became the most celebrated man of the day in that craft. Philip
  II. of Spain made him his chief printer, and under royal orders Plantin
  produced the well-known Polyglot Bible in eight folio volumes
  (1568-1573). He had previously printed some smaller books of Emblems
  (1564), and <i>Devises Héroïques</i> (1562), and had employed Pierre
  Huys, Lucas de Heere, Godefroid Ballain, and other artists, to illustrate
  them. He died in 1589. His second daughter married Jean Moret, one of the
  overseers of <!-- Page 98 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page98"></a>{98}</span>the printing-office, and the business known
  as 'Plantin-Moretus' continued to prosper up to the present century. A
  few years since the offices were bought by the city authorities, and the
  Plantin Museum is now one of the principal attractions of Antwerp. In his
  various works Plantin used many woodcuts, but most of his title-pages
  have borders executed by Wierix, Pass, and other celebrated copperplate
  engravers. His device was a Hand with a pair of compasses, and his motto
  <i>Labore et Constantia</i>.</p>

  <p>The history of wood-engraving and wood-engravers in Holland forms the
  subject of a monograph from the pen of Mr. W. M. Conway ('The Woodcutters
  of the Netherlands,' Cambridge, 1884). The list commences with a Louvain
  engraver, who worked for Veldener in 1475, and about the same time for
  John and Conrad de Westphalia.</p>

  <p>Most of the greater Dutch towns had wood-engravers, and the work of
  these artists appears in many of the books printed in the Low Countries.
  As in France, many of the printers' marks are very good.</p>

  <p>It was in this century that publishers began to illustrate their books
  with copperplate engravings, which soon came into general use, and these
  plates for many years, to a very great extent, superseded engraving on
  wood. Etchings by the artist's own hands are also frequently met with,
  and to these causes we may in a great measure attribute the decay of the
  Formschneider's art for at least two centuries.</p>

<h5>CHAPTER XI</h5>

<h5><i>IN THE SIXTEENTH AND SEVENTEENTH CENTURIES IN GERMANY&#x2c; ITALY AND ENGLAND</i></h5>

  <p>In the portfolios of collectors of works of art of the sixteenth
  century we frequently meet with very interesting examples of printing in
  <i>chiaro-oscuro</i>, as it was called, by means of successive
  impressions of engraved wood-blocks. Sometimes two or three blocks were
  used, sometimes six or eight, in all cases with the intention of
  reproducing the appearance of a tinted water-colour drawing or an
  oil-painting. Those prints which were the least ambitious were the most
  successful, They were generally printed in various shades of grey and
  brown&mdash;from light sepia to deep umber&mdash;and sometimes the
  effects are admirable. A well-known designer and engraver on wood, Ugo da
  Carpi (c. 1520), introduced this new style of printing into Venice, and
  other artists, Antonio da Trento, Andrea Andreani, Bartolomeo Coriolano,
  and others made many successful efforts in a similar direction; their
  best works are much prized.</p>

  <p>At the same time a group of Venetian artists, who were also engravers
  on wood, distinguished themselves by copying the works of Titian and
  other Italian painters. The most celebrated of these engravers were
  Nicolo Boldrini, Francesco da Nanto, Giovanni Battista del Porto, and
  Giuseppe Scolari, who all flourished between the years 1530 and 1580.
  Their <!-- Page 100 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page100"></a>{100}</span>productions, which are on a large scale,
  are greatly valued by artists.</p>

  <p>Near the end of the century a book of costume entitled <i>Habiti
  Antichi e Moderni di tutto il Mondo</i> was designed and published at
  Venice by Cesare Vecellio, who is said to have been a nephew of the great
  Titian. This work contains nearly six hundred figures in the costume of
  every age and country, admirably drawn and engraved; indeed, they are the
  best examples of the art of wood-engraving in Italy at the time. This
  excellent work was reproduced in their well-known style by Messrs.
  Firmin, Didot &amp; Cie in two volumes (Paris, 1860).</p>

  <p>An edition of 'Dante' published by the brothers Sessa at Venice in
  1578 is well illustrated with good woodcuts.</p>

  <p>German artists were also bitten at this time with a mania for
  reproducing pictures by means of colour blocks. The results, however,
  were much more curious than beautiful. We have before us a copy of a
  painting designed by Altdorfer, one of the 'Little Masters,' of 'The
  Virgin with the Holy Infant on her Lap,' set in an elaborate
  architectural frame. In this print at least eight different colour-blocks
  were used, among them a deep red and a vivid green. The printer's
  register has been fairly well kept, and the mechanical part of the work
  is worthy of all praise; but we fear the effect on most of our readers
  would be to produce anything but admiration. A Saint Christopher,
  designed and probably engraved by Lucas Cranach, printed in black and
  deep umber, only with the high lights carefully cut out of the latter
  block, is much more satisfactory.</p>

  <p>In the middle and towards the end of the sixteenth century there were
  several excellent wood-engravings published in London in illustration of
  Foxe's 'Book of Martyrs' (1562), Holinshed's 'Chronicles of England,
  Scotland, and Ireland' (1577), 'A Booke of Christian Prayers' (1569), and
  other works, chiefly from the press of the celebrated John Daye. <!--

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:47%;">

  </div>

<p><!-- Page 102 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page102"></a>{102}</span></p>

  <p>As an example we give one of the illustrations of Holinshed's
  Chronicles as a frontispiece. There can be no doubt that Holbein designed
  it; the ornamentation alone would almost prove it to be from his hand.
  The title-page of the 'Bishops' Bible,' printed about the same time, has
  a finely engraved border, representing the King handing the volume to the
  Bishops, who in turn present it to the people. There are many woodcuts in
  the text, but they are of very low merit.</p>

  <p>We give an illustration of 'A Booke of Christian Prayers,' known as
  Queen Elizabeth's Prayer-book, from a fine portrait of Her Majesty
  kneeling on a handsome cushion, with clasped hands before a kind of
  altar. The Queen's dress is magnificent, and the ornamentation of the
  whole design is of a similar character. It is an excellent piece of
  engraving, and we are able to give a facsimile of it, cut about sixty
  years ago by George Bonner. Mr. Linton thinks the original was on metal;
  who engraved it is at present unknown. We fear there was no one in
  England who could produce such work, nor can anyone tell who made the
  design. It is printed on the back of the title-page, which is decorated
  with a border of a 'Jesse-tree,' with a figure of Jesse at the foot and
  the Virgin with the Holy Infant on her lap at the head. There are woodcut
  borders to each of the 274 pages, all betraying German origin, and
  evidently by different hands. A few floral designs and single figures of
  'Temperance,' 'Charity,' and the like are the best. Among the rest is a
  series of 'Dance of Death' pictures, but <i>not</i> by Holbein. Another
  edition of this work was printed in 1590 at London, 'By Richard Yardley
  and Peter Short for the assignes of Richard Day dwelling in Bred-street
  hill at the signe of the Starre.' [Doubtless this was on the site of the
  present printing office of Richard Clay &amp; Sons.] Richard Day was a
  son of John Day or Daye, as we often find the name printed.</p>

  <p>Another illustrated book, 'The Cosmographical Glasse, conteinyng the
  pleasant Principles of Cosmographie, Geographie, Hydrographie or
  Navigation. Compiled by William Cuningham, Doctor in Physicke' (of
  Norwich), was printed by John Day in 1559, with many cuts. In the
  ornamental title-page there is a large bird's-eye view of the city of
  Norwich, with a mark of the engraver, I. B. There is also a large and
  well-engraved portrait of the author, 'ætatis 28,' a rather sad-looking
  young man; and many initial letters, some of which have a small I. D. at
  the foot, which probably tell us that John Day himself engraved them.
  Others have a small I inside a larger C, and this monogram appears
  frequently on the small cuts in the border of Queen Elizabeth's Book of
  Prayers. John Day tells us in a work published in 1567 that the Saxon
  type in which it is printed was <i>cut</i> by himself.</p>

  <p>John Day was a great friend of John Foxe, and assisted him in
  producing his celebrated 'Acts and Monuments of the Church,' generally
  known as his 'Booke of Martyrs.' In the 'Acts and Monuments,' printed in
  1576, there is a large initial C, evidently drawn and engraved by the
  artists who produced the Queen's portrait. In this initial, Elizabetha
  Regina is seen seated in state, with her feet resting on the same cushion
  that appears in the larger print, attended by three of her Privy
  Councillors standing at her right hand. A figure of the Pope with two
  <i>broken</i> keys in his hands forms part of the decoration of the base;
  an immense cornucopia reaches over the top.</p>

  <p>Early in the seventeenth century we meet with the name of an excellent
  wood-engraver at Antwerp, Christoph Jegher, who worked for many years
  with Peter Paul Rubens, and produced many large woodcuts. We are enabled
  to give a much-reduced copy of a 'Flight into Egypt,' which in the
  original is nearly twenty-four inches in length. Underneath appears the
  inscription, <i>P. P. Rub. delin. &amp; excud.</i>, from which we learn
  that Rubens himself superintended the <!-- Page 105 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page105"></a>{105}</span>printing, for <i>C.
  Jegher sculp.</i> appears on the other side. Some of this series of cuts
  were printed with a tint of sepia over them in imitation of the Italian
  chiaro-oscuro prints of the previous century. Christoph Jegher was born
  in Germany in 1590 (?) and died at Antwerp in 1670. He lived through many
  tempestuous years and did much good work. A contemporary wood-engraver
  named Cornelius van Sichem, living at Amsterdam, produced a few excellent
  cuts from drawings by Heinrich Goltzius (<i>d.</i> 1617), who copied the
  Italian school.</p>

    <i>Reduced copy of the engraving by C. Jegher</i>
  </div>

  <p>At the end of the seventeenth century the art of wood-engraving
  reached its lowest ebb. There were a few tolerably good mechanical
  engravers on the Continent, who were <!-- Page 106 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page106"></a>{106}</span>chiefly employed in the
  manufacture of ornaments for cards, and head and tail pieces for books
  and ballads, but nearly all the woodcuts we meet with in English books
  are of the most childish character. The rage for copper-plate engravings
  had set in with so much vigour among all the printers and publishers that
  the poor wood-engraver was well-nigh forgotten.</p>

  <p>In London a new edition of 'Æsop's Fables,' edited by Dr. Samuel
  Croxall, and illustrated with many woodcuts much better engraved than was
  customary at the time, was published by Jacob Tonson at the Shakespear's
  Head, in the Strand, in 1722. We do not learn the names of the artists.
  In 1724 Elisha Kirkall engraved and published seventeen Views of
  Shipping, from designs by W. Vandevelde, which he printed in a greenish
  kind of ink; and in a portfolio full of woodcuts in the Print Room of the
  British Museum Mr. W. J. Linton recently discovered a large Card of
  Invitation (query&mdash;to a wedding?) from Mr. Elisha and <i>Mrs.</i>
  Elizabeth Kirkall, dated '<i>August</i> the 31st, 1709. Printed at His
  Majesty's Printing Office in <i>Blackfryers</i>,' which is very firmly
  and boldly engraved, probably in soft metal. On the left of the Royal
  Arms, Fame, blowing a trumpet, holds up a circular medallion portrait of
  Guttenburgh (we follow the spelling); a similar figure on the right holds
  the portrait of W. Caxton and a scroll; at the foot, in the middle, is a
  view of London Bridge over the Thames, with the Monument and St. Paul's
  Cathedral, and on either side is a Cupid&mdash;one with a torch and a
  dove, with masonic emblems at his feet, the other with attributes of
  painting, sculpture, and music. The Cupids are very like the fat-faced
  little cherubim we so constantly meet with on seventeenth-century
  monuments, though Mr. Linton has nothing but praise to give to the
  engraving, which he says is the first example of the use of the 'white
  line' in English work.</p>

  <p>In Paris there was a family of three generations of <!-- Page 107
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page107"></a>{107}</span>engravers
  named Papillon, who illustrated hundreds of books with small and very
  fine cuts, in evident imitation of the copper-plates then so much in
  vogue. Jean Michel Papillon, the youngest of them, published a <i>Traité
  Historique et Pratique de la Gravure en Bois</i>, in two volumes with a
  supplement, which, though full of credulous errors, has been of
  inestimable service to all writers on the history of wood-engraving. This
  Papillon was probably in England at one time, for he received a prize
  from the Society of Arts. He was born in the year 1698, began to engrave
  blocks when only eight years old, and lived till the year 1776.</p>

<h5>CHAPTER XII</h5>

<h5><i>THOMAS BEWICK AND HIS PUPILS</i></h5>

  <p>In the year 1775, the Society for the Encouragement of Arts offered a
  series of small money premiums for the best engravings on wood. These
  prizes were won by Thomas Hodgson, William Coleman, both then living in
  London, and Thomas Bewick, of Newcastle, who sent up for competition five
  engravings intended to illustrate a new edition of 'Gay's Fables.' It is
  of the last of these three&mdash;who received an award of seven guineas,
  which he immediately gave over to his mother&mdash;that we have now to
  write. He was born at Cherryburn, a farmhouse on the south bank of the
  Tyne, in the parish of Ovingham, about twelve miles from Newcastle, in
  August 1753. This we learn from an inscription now over the door of the
  'byre,' or cowshed, which is still standing. His father was a farmer, who
  also rented a small coal-pit at Mickley, close by. After having received
  a fair education at local schools and at Ovingham parsonage, young
  Thomas, who had shown a great love of drawing, was in October 1767
  apprenticed to Ralph Beilby, a general engraver, in St. Nicholas'
  Churchyard, Newcastle. Here the boy learned to cut diagrams in wood,
  engrave copper-plates for books, tradesmen's cards, etch ornament on
  sword-blades, and other work of the kind, much as Hogarth had done some
  fifty years before him; and, as luck would have it, his master received
  an <!-- Page 109 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page109"></a>{109}</span>order to engrave a series of wood-blocks
  to illustrate a 'Treatise on Mensuration' written by Mr. Charles Hutton,
  a schoolmaster in Newcastle&mdash;afterwards Dr. Hutton, a Fellow of the
  Royal Society. This work was issued in fifty sixpenny numbers, and
  published in a quarto volume in 1770. It was on this book that Thomas
  Bewick trained his 'prentice hand in the art in which he was afterwards
  to become so famous.</p>

  <p>At the end of his apprenticeship in 1774, he worked with his old
  master for a short time at a guinea a week; then he went to live for a
  time at Cherryburn, and in 1776, with three guineas sewed in his
  waist-band, he walked to Edinburgh, Glasgow, and northwards to the
  Highlands, always staying at farm-houses on the road. He returned to
  Newcastle in a Leith sloop, and, after working till he had earned
  sufficient money, took a berth in a collier for London, where he arrived
  in October and soon found several Newcastle friends. But London life did
  not suit this child of the country-side. 'I would rather be herding sheep
  on Mickley bank top,' he writes to a friend, 'than remain in London,
  although for so doing I was to be made Premier of England.'</p>

  <p>Soon after his return to Newcastle he joined his old master in
  partnership, and took his younger brother, John, as an apprentice, and
  for eight years the brothers made a weekly visit to Cherryburn, often
  fishing by the way. In the year 1785, their mother, father, and eldest
  sister all died, and in the following year Thomas Bewick married Isabella
  Elliot, of Ovingham, one of the companions of his childhood. He was at
  that time living in the 'fine, low, old-fashioned house'&mdash;with a
  long garden behind it, in which he cultivated roses&mdash;formerly
  occupied by Dr. Hutton; and going daily to work in the old house
  overlooking St. Nicholas' Churchyard.</p>

  <p>We have previously said that the early wood-engravings were cut with a
  knife, held like a pen and drawn towards the craftsman, on 'planks' of
  the soft wood of the pear or <!-- Page 110 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page110"></a>{110}</span>apple-tree, or some similar tree. It is
  believed that Bewick was the first who used the wood of the box-tree,
  which is very hard, and who made his drawings on the butt-ends of the
  blocks, and cut his lines with the graver pushed from him. He brought
  into practice what is known as the 'white line' in wood-engraving; that
  is, he produced his effects more by means of many white lines wide apart
  to give an appearance of lightness, and by giving closer lines to produce
  a grey effect, as in our cut of 'The Yellowhammer.' He gave up the old
  method of obtaining 'colour,' as it is termed, by means of
  cross-hatching, and used a much simpler and more expeditious way of
  giving depth of shadow by leaving solid masses of the block, which of
  course printed black&mdash;and he constantly adopted the plan of lowering
  the wood in the background, and such parts of the block as were required
  to be printed lightly.</p>

    THE YELLOWHAMMER<br />
    (<i>From</i> '<i>The Land Birds</i>')
  </div>

<p><!-- Page 111 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page111"></a>{111}</span></p>

  <p>The first book of real importance that was illustrated by Thomas
  Bewick was the 'Select Fables' published by Saint of Newcastle in 1784;
  this is now very rare; there is, however, a copy in the British Museum
  (press-mark 12305 g 16) which can at all times be consulted. Most of the
  designs are derived from 'Croxall's Fables,' and many of these were
  copied from the copper-plates by Francis Barlow in his edition of Æsop,
  published 'at his house, The Golden Eagle, in New Street, near Shoo Lane,
  1665.' Though Bewick improved the drawings, there was little originality
  in them, but the engravings were far in advance of any other work of the
  kind done at that period. The success of this book induced him to carry
  out an idea he had long entertained of producing a series of
  illustrations for a 'General History of Quadrupeds,' on which he was
  engaged for six years, making the drawings and engraving them mostly in
  the evening. He tells us he had much difficulty in finding models, and
  was delighted when a travelling menagerie visited Newcastle and enabled
  him to depict many wild animals from nature. It was while he was employed
  on this work that he received a commission to make an engraving of a
  'Chillingham Bull,' one of those famous wild cattle to which Sir Walter
  Scott refers in his ballad, 'Cadyow Castle':</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Mightiest of all the beasts of chase</p>
      <p class="i2">That roam in woody Caledon.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>He made the drawing on a block 7¾ inches by 5½ inches, and used his
  highest powers in rendering it as true to nature as he could; it is said
  that he always considered it to be his best work. After a few impressions
  had been taken off on paper and parchment, the block, which had been
  carelessly left by the printers in the direct rays of the sun, was split
  by the heat; and, though it was in after years clamped in gun-metal, no
  impressions could be taken which did not show <!-- Page 112 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page112"></a>{112}</span>a trace of the
  accident. Happily, one of the original impressions on parchment may be
  seen in the Townsend Collection in the South Kensington Museum. Meanwhile
  the 'Quadrupeds' were going on bravely: Ralph Beilby compiled the
  necessary text, which Bewick revised where he could, and in 1790 the book
  was published. It sold so well that a second edition was issued in 1791,
  and a third in 1792. Since then it has been frequently reprinted. [The
  first edition consisted of 1,500 copies in demy octavo at 8<i>s.</i>, and
  100 in royal octavo at 12<i>s.</i> The price of the eighth edition, with
  additional cuts, published in 1825, was one guinea.]</p>

    TAIL-PIECE<br />
    (<i>From 'The Quadrupeds'</i>)
  </div>

  <p>Besides the engravings of quadrupeds, the best that had appeared up to
  that time, the numerous tail-pieces which Bewick drew from nature charmed
  the public immensely. We give an example, one of them in which a small
  boy, said to be a young brother of the artist, is pulling a colt's tail,
  while the mother is rushing to his rescue. This little cut gives an
  admirable idea of their style. Many of them are humorous, many very
  pathetic, many grimly sarcastic, and all perfectly original. <!-- Page

    THE WOODCOCK<br />
    (<i>From 'The Water Birds'</i>)
  </div>

  <p>As soon as the success of the 'Quadrupeds' was assured, Bewick
  commenced without delay his still more celebrated book, the 'History of
  British Birds.' In making the drawings for this work he was much more at
  home, for he knew every feathered creature that flew within twenty miles
  of Ovingham, and it was all 'labour of love.' He worked with all his soul
  first at the 'Land Birds' and afterwards at the 'Water Birds,' and it is
  on these two books that Bewick's fame both as a draughtsman and an
  engraver principally rests. We give a copy of the 'Yellowhammer,' which
  the artist himself considered to be one of his best works, and the
  'Woodcock,' in which all the excellences of his peculiar style may
  readily be traced.</p>

  <p>The first volume, the 'Land Birds,' appeared in 1797, and was received
  with rapture by all lovers of nature. Again, <!-- Page 114 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page114"></a>{114}</span>the tail-pieces,
  pictures in miniature, were applauded to the skies, and the gratified
  author was beset on all sides with congratulations. Mr. Beilby wrote the
  descriptions as before, and performed his work very creditably.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:43%;">

    A FARMYARD<br />
    (<i>From 'The Land Birds'</i>)
  </div>

  <p>The partnership between Ralph Beilby and Thomas Bewick was dissolved
  in 1797, and the descriptions to the second volume, 'The Water Birds,'
  which did not appear till 1804, were written by Bewick himself, and
  revised by the Rev. H. Cotes, Vicar of Bedlington. It is known that
  Bewick was assisted in the tail-pieces by his pupils, Robert Johnson as a
  draughtsman, and Luke Clennell as an engraver, but it is certain that
  every line was done under his immediate superintendence, and no doubt the
  originator of these excellent works was beginning to feel that he was no
  longer young. <!-- Page 115 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page115"></a>{115}</span></p>

  <p>[Of the first edition of the 'Land Birds' 1,000 were printed in demy
  octavo at 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, 850 on thin and thick royal octavo, at
  13<i>s.</i> and 15<i>s.</i>, and twenty-four on imperial octavo at £1
  1<i>s.</i> The first edition of the 'Water Birds' in 1804 consisted of
  the same number of copies as that of the 'Land Birds,' but the prices
  were increased respectively to 12<i>s.</i>, 15<i>s.</i>, 18<i>s.</i>, and
  £1 4<i>s.</i>]</p>

  <p>The only book of importance on which Bewick was engaged after 1804 was
  an edition of 'Æsop's Fables,' which was published in 1818. Mr. Chatto
  says: 'Whatever may be the merits or defects of the cuts in the Fables,
  Bewick certainly had little to do with them&mdash;for by far the greater
  number were designed by Robert Johnson and engraved by W. W. Temple and
  William Harvey, while yet in their apprenticeship.' Bewick amused himself
  by re-writing the Fables, to which he contributed a few of his own, but
  he was in no sense a literary man, and several of his greatest admirers
  openly expressed their disappointment at the book; even his supreme
  advocate, Dr. Dibdin, said: 'I will fearlessly and honestly aver that his
  "Æsop" disappointed me.'</p>

  <p>In 1826 Bewick lost his wife, who left to his care one son and three
  daughters. In the summer of 1828 he visited London alone; he was not in
  good health, took but little interest in what was going on, and soon
  longed to return home. There he was busy as ever on a large cut of an old
  horse 'Waiting for Death' (which Mr. Linton has faithfully copied). Early
  in November he took the block to the printers to be proved, and after a
  few days' illness, he died on November 8, 1828. He was buried in Ovingham
  churchyard, where a tablet is erected to his memory. But his books are
  his true monument, and they will live for ever.</p>

<h5>CHAPTER XIII</h5>

<h5><i>THOMAS BEWICK'S SUCCESSORS</i></h5>

  <p>It redounds greatly to the glory of Thomas Bewick that the important
  advance in the art of wood-engraving which was due to his talents and his
  industry did not die with him. He left behind him several eminent
  successors, whose influence is felt to the present day.</p>

  <p>His brother John, seven years younger than himself, was his first
  pupil, and to him we are indebted for the illustrations to a work called
  'Emblems of Mortality,' 1789, copied from Holbein's 'Dance of Death,' the
  'Looking-Glass for the Mind,' and 'Blossoms of Morality,' 1796. Of these,
  the cuts in the 'Looking-Glass for the Mind' are decidedly the best, and
  after examining them carefully we cannot but regret that the artist was
  taken away so young. His drawings are very unlike those of his elder
  brother, and are certainly more graceful&mdash;we give one as an example
  of their style. Two other books, 'Poems,' by Goldsmith and Parnell, 1795,
  and Somerville's 'Chase,' 1796, also contain some of his best work; they
  were printed in quarto by Bulmer, 'to display the excellence of modern
  printing and wood-engraving.' For the former of these, John Bewick made
  most of the drawings, in which he was assisted by the clever artist,
  Robert Johnson, a fellow-pupil, and nearly all were engraved by Thomas
  and John Bewick, and a few by another pupil, Charlton Nesbit. <!-- Page
  117 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page117"></a>{117}</span>For 'The
  Chase,' John Bewick made all the drawings except one, and nearly all were
  engraved by his brother. For five or six years John Bewick lived in
  London, till ill-health compelled him to return to his native place,
  where he died in the same year in which Somerville's 'Chase' was
  published. He was buried in Ovingham churchyard, where a tablet is
  erected to his memory.</p>

      alt="Little Anthony" title="Little Anthony" /></a>
    LITTLE ANTHONY. BY JOHN BEWICK<br />
    <i>From 'Looking-Glass for the Mind'</i>
  </div>

  <p>Robert Elliot Bewick, the only son of Thomas Bewick, was trained to
  the business of wood-engraver, and at one time, over the window of the
  house in St. Nicholas' Churchyard, there was a board with an inscription
  '<span class="sc">Bewick and Son</span>, <i>engravers and copper-plate
  printers</i>.' Robert suffered much from ill-health and turned his
  attention to drawing rather than engraving. He died in 1849, leaving
  fifty beautiful designs for a 'History of Fishes,' which he had long in
  contemplation as a companion volume to his father's works. <!-- Page 118
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page118"></a>{118}</span>These
  drawings, the gift of the last of Bewick's daughters, are now in the
  British Museum.</p>

  <p>The most celebrated of Bewick's other pupils were Charlton Nesbit,
  born at Shalwell, near Gateshead, in 1775; Luke Clennell, born at Ulgham,
  a village near Morpeth, in 1781; and William Harvey, born near Newcastle
  in 1796. Nesbit engraved a few of the tail-pieces in the 'Land Birds,'
  and most of the head and tail pieces in the 'Poems' of Goldsmith and
  Parnell. He also engraved, from a drawing by Robert Johnson, a large
  block, 15 inches by 12 inches, of St. Nicholas Church, Newcastle, which
  at the time was considered a triumph of art. About the end of the century
  Nesbit migrated to London, where for many years he was employed by
  Rudolph Ackermann and other publishers in engraving the drawings of the
  artist, John Thurston, whose work was at that time very popular. In 1815
  Nesbit returned to Shalwell, where he continued to reside till 1830,
  doing but little work besides the engraving of 'Rinaldo and Armida' for
  Savage's 'Hints on Decorative Printing,' after a design by Thurston. This
  is considered to be his best work. He then went back to London, and was
  chiefly engaged in engraving drawings by William Harvey for the second
  volume of Northcote's 'Fables.' He died at Queen's Elms in November 1838,
  aged 63. Mr. Chatto says: 'Nesbit is unquestionably the best
  wood-engraver that has proceeded from the great northern hive of
  art&mdash;the workshop of Thomas Bewick.'</p>

  <p>The story of Luke Clennell's life is very sad. Like many other
  artists, he showed an early disposition to make sketches on his slate
  instead of 'doing sums,' and was often reproved; his uncle sympathised
  with him, and in 1797 apprenticed him to Thomas Bewick for the usual
  seven years, during which time he engraved many of the tail-pieces to the
  'Water Birds' and learned to make water-colour drawings from nature. When
  his apprenticeship was over he assisted Bewick in the illustrations to a
  'History of England,' <!-- Page 119 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page119"></a>{119}</span>published by Wallis and Scholey, in which
  Nisbet had also joined, but finding that Bewick was paid five pounds for
  each cut, while he received only two pounds, Clennell sent some specimens
  of his abilities to the publishers, who immediately offered him work in
  London, where he arrived in the autumn of 1804. Two years afterwards he
  received the gold palette of the Society of Arts for a wood-engraving of
  a battle-scene, and soon afterwards he was engaged on illustrations to
  new editions of Beattie's 'Minstrel,' 1807, and Falconer's 'Shipwreck,'
  1808. About this time he married the eldest daughter of Charles Warren, a
  well-known line engraver, and became intimate with Abraham Raimbach and
  other artists whose friendship was of much service to him. His most
  important work as a wood-engraver was the 'Diploma of the Highland
  Society,' a large block 13½ inches by 10½ inches, of which we give a
  much-reduced copy. Benjamin West made the original design on paper,
  Clennell himself drew the Highlander and Fisherman on the wood, and gave
  Thurston fifteen pounds to fill in the circle with Britannia and her
  attendant groups. After he had worked on the block, which was of boxwood
  veneered upon beech, for about two months, the same fate befell it that
  had ruined Bewick's 'Chillingham Bull'; one evening, while he was at tea,
  the boxwood split with a loud report, and it is said poor Clennell threw
  the tea-things into the fire! This was the sad beginning of a long
  malady. Taking courage, however, he procured a block made of pieces of
  solid boxwood firmly clamped together, paid Thurston again for drawing
  the central groups, and, after much labour, produced his <i>chef
  d'&oelig;uvre</i>, for which he received 150 guineas from the Highland
  Society, and was further rewarded with the gold medal of the Society of
  Arts, May 30, 1809. This second block likewise met with an untimely fate;
  it was burnt in the fire at Bensley's printing-office. John Thompson
  afterwards engraved it in fac-simile. A copy of Clennell's original
  engraving, bequeathed by Mr. John <!-- Page 120 --><span

    DIPLOMA OF THE HIGHLAND SOCIETY<br />
    <i>Engraved by Luke Clennell</i>
  </div>

  <p>Among the best wood-engravings by Clennell we may rank the
  illustrations designed by Stothard as head and tail pieces for a small
  edition of Rogers's 'Pleasures of Memory,' 1810. They were drawn in pen
  and ink, and engraved in facsimile with charming spirit and fidelity.
  After this time, Clennell, who could work beautifully in water-colours,
  gave up engraving and exhibited drawings and paintings at the Academy,
  the British Institution, and the Exhibition of Painters in Water-Colours
  at their room in Spring Gardens. In March 1815, the British <!-- Page 121
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page121"></a>{121}</span>Institution
  set aside 1,000 guineas for premiums for the best oil-paintings
  illustrating the career of Wellington. One of these premiums was awarded
  to Clennell for his 'Charge of the Life Guards at Waterloo,' a picture
  full of spirit, which was afterwards engraved. In 1814 the Earl of
  Bridgewater gave him a commission to paint 'The Banquet of the Allied
  Sovereigns in Guildhall.' He experienced great difficulty in obtaining
  sitters for the necessary portraits, and suffered so much from anxiety
  that, although in April 1817 he had nearly conquered all his troubles, he
  suddenly lost his reason. This so much affected his wife that she also
  became insane and soon died. By the advice of his friends poor Clennell
  was sent to live with a relation who resided near Newcastle, and there he
  lingered till February 1840, when he died, leaving three children, who
  were for a time supported in a great measure by the Committee of the
  Artists' Fund and by the profits of the engraving of the 'Charge of the
  Life Guards.'</p>

  <p>William Harvey was apprenticed to Bewick in 1810 and was his favourite
  pupil. He frequently made drawings on the wood after the designs of
  Robert Johnson, and engraved many of the cuts in 'Bewick's Fables,' 1818.
  On New Year's Day 1815 Bewick presented him with a copy of his 'History
  of British Birds' in two volumes, which he always showed to his friends
  with much pride. In September 1817 Harvey came to London and, to improve
  his knowledge of drawing, took lessons of an excellent master&mdash;B. R.
  Haydon. While under his tuition Harvey copied his picture of the
  'Assassination of Dentatus' on a large block, and engraved it with most
  elaborate care. This cut has always been greatly admired by the
  profession, who point to the variety of the lines of engraving in the
  right leg of Dentatus as being a triumph of their art. If we can find any
  fault with this celebrated work, it is that, to use Mr. Chatto's words,
  'More has been attempted than can be efficiently <!-- Page 122 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page122"></a>{122}</span>represented by means of
  wood-engraving'&mdash;it is, in fact, too much like an attempt to rival
  copper-plate line-engraving.</p>

  <p>About the year 1824 Harvey had so many commissions for designs for
  both copper-plates and woodcuts that he gave up entirely the practice of
  engraving, and devoted himself to drawings for the illustration of books.
  His first successes were his vignettes for Dr. Henderson's 'History of
  Ancient and Modern Wines,' 1824, the illustrations to Northcote's
  'Fables,' 1828 and 1833, the 'Tower Menagerie,' 1828, 'Gardens and
  Menagerie of the Zoological Society,' 1831, and 'The Children in the
  Wood' and a 'Story without an End,' 1832. But perhaps his most
  characteristic designs were the illustrations to Lane's 'Thousand and One
  Nights' in 1834-40; these are considered to be his best work. He was at
  this time at the height of his reputation, and for twenty-six years more
  he almost monopolised the illustration of books published in London.
  Merely to give a list of them would occupy too much space. During the
  latter years of his life, Harvey lived near the old church of Richmond,
  and there he died in 1866. He was one of the most courteous and amiable
  of men, and though his designs were 'mannered,' they were always pleasant
  to look at, and often very poetical.</p>

  <p>There were other pupils of Bewick who obtained some little fame. Among
  them were John Anderson, a native of Scotland, who assisted Thurston in
  illustrating Bloomfield's 'Farmer's Boy,' published in 1800 by Vernor and
  Hood; John Jackson, who was born at Ovingham in 1801, and Ebenezer
  Landells, born at Newcastle in 1808. Jackson for some reason quarrelled
  with his master, came to London and worked for William Harvey, who was
  much employed about that time in making illustrations for the various
  works issued by Charles Knight, including the 'Penny Magazine,' Knight's
  'Shakspere,' 'Pictorial Bible,' 'Pictorial Prayer-book,' and a hundred
  other books which appeared between 1828 and 1840&mdash;under the auspices
  of that enterprising publisher. Some of <!-- Page 123 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page123"></a>{123}</span>Jackson's best work
  will be found in the 'Tower Menagerie' and other illustrations of animals
  designed by Harvey. He will always be remembered for the share he took in
  the 'Treatise on Wood-Engraving,' for which Mr. Chatto wrote the text.
  This work was undertaken at the sole risk of Mr. Jackson, who engraved
  many of the three hundred illustrations. It is a very valuable book and,
  supplemented by Mr. Linton's 'Masters of Wood-Engraving,' tells pretty
  well all that is ever likely to be known of this fascinating art. Jackson
  died in London in the year 1848.</p>

  <p>At the death of Bewick, Ebenezer Landells came to London, 1829, and
  soon found employment in engraving designs for the <i>Illustrated London
  News</i>, <i>Punch</i>, and other periodicals. His studio became quite a
  nursery of art, and many excellent draughtsmen&mdash;among them, Birket
  Foster&mdash;and engravers were educated under his superintendence. He
  died at Brompton in 1860, the last of Bewick's pupils.</p>

  <p>Going back to the last century we find that we have omitted to speak
  of another self-taught wood-engraver, Robert Branston, who was born in
  1778 at Lynn in Norfolk. When he was twenty-one years of age he settled
  in London and soon found employment in working for the publishers. He
  engraved the 'Cave of Despair' from a drawing by Thurston for Savage's
  'Hints on Decorative Printing' in rivalry with Nesbit's 'Rinaldo and
  Armida'; this is considered to be his best work. He also assisted in
  engraving the cuts in Scholey's 'History of England,' Bloomfield's 'Wild
  Flowers,' 1806, and a series of 'Fables' after Thurston's designs which,
  though beautifully executed, were never published. He died at Brompton in
  1827. Among his pupils were his son, Robert Branston the younger, who for
  many years produced excellent work.</p>

    <i>Engraved by John Thompson</i>
  </div>

  <p>John Thompson, one of the princes of wood-engravers, was born in
  Manchester in 1785, came to London early in life, and, after practising
  for some years under Robert Branston the elder, soon gained great
  distinction in his art. Like all other wood-engravers of the period, he
  was employed chiefly in rendering the designs of Thurston. In 1818 he
  engraved the illustrations to a new edition of Butler's 'Hudibras,' and
  about the same time he was engaged by the Bank of England to produce a
  bank-note which could not be imitated. Then followed the illustrations to
  the 'Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green,' 1832, Shakespeare, 1836, and the
  'Arabian Nights,' 1841, all after designs by William Harvey. He also
  engraved many of the beautiful cuts in the books of Natural History
  published by Van Voorst. In <!-- Page 125 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page125"></a>{125}</span>1843 he produced the work for which he
  will for ever be celebrated, the illustrations to the 'Vicar of
  Wakefield' from the drawings by Mulready&mdash;one of the most charming
  books ever published. It would take too much time to enumerate even the
  best of the engravings he executed in his long life. We must not,
  however, forget to mention that he engraved in gun-metal Mulready's
  design for a postal envelope in 1839, and the figure of Britannia which
  is still printed on Bank of England notes. He presented his collection of
  valuable woodcuts to the Art Library at South Kensington, and died at
  Kensington in 1866, aged 81. His son, Thurston Thompton, was also an
  excellent engraver.</p>

  <p>Among the other celebrated wood-engravers of the latter half of this
  century were John and Mary Byfield, who engraved the facsimile cuts of
  Holbein's 'Dance of Death' and 'Scenes from Old Testament History' for
  Pickering's editions of these celebrated works; W. H. Powis, some of
  whose best work may be seen in 'Solace of Song'; J. Orrin Smith, born in
  Colchester in 1800, who placed himself under the tuition of William
  Harvey, and became a very expert craftsman, and whose best work may be
  seen in Wordsworth's 'Greece,' 'The Solace of Song,' Lane's 'Arabian
  Nights,' and in 'Paul et Virginie,' published by Curmer of
  Paris&mdash;Orrin Smith died in 1843; Samuel Williams, also a native of
  Colchester, who designed on the wood most of the works which he
  engraved&mdash;he was famous for his country scenes, the best of which
  are in Thomson's 'Seasons' and Cowper's 'Poems,' published about
  1840&mdash;he died in 1853 in his 65th year; W. T. Green and Thomas
  Bolton, both excellent reproducers of landscape, and especially of the
  drawings of Birket Foster; Charles Gray, and Samuel V. Slader, all of the
  first repute; Orlando Jewitt, celebrated both for his beautiful
  reproductions of architectural work, for Parker's 'Glossary,' and other
  important works; and, lately, we have lost J. Greenaway, brother of the
  famous artist, Kate <!-- Page 126 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page126"></a>{126}</span>Greenaway, and W. J. Palmer, both
  excellent men and engravers of the very first class.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:46%;">

    O'ERARCHED WITH OAKS THAT FORM FANTASTIC BOWERS
  </div>

  <p>Still with us, we can only mention in a few words the modern prince of
  wood-engravers, W. J. Linton, who has for <!-- Page 127 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page127"></a>{127}</span>many years resided in
  America; W. L. Thomas, the originator of <i>The Graphic</i> newspaper,
  and one of the ablest artists in water-colours in 'The Institute'; Edmund
  Evans and Horace Harral, who so successfully rendered Birket Foster's
  drawings some years ago; J. W. Whymper, the brothers Dalziel and James
  Cooper, the producers of thousands of good engravings, and a
  comparatively new man, W. Biscombe Gardner, who excels in
  portraiture.</p>

  <p>In Germany, during the last half-century, wood-engraving met with much
  encouragement, and reverting to the earlier and purer style of the
  fifteenth century, many artists and engravers produced work of great
  merit: E. Kretzschmar, of Leipsic, the brothers A. and O. Vogel, F.
  Unzelmann and H. Müller, rendered the drawings of Adolf Menzel and Ludwig
  Richter with careful exactitude. In the atelier of Hugo Bürkner, of
  Dresden, the much-admired 'Death as a Friend,' by Rethel, was engraved by
  Jungtow, and 'Death as an Enemy' by Steinbrecher: and A. Gaber, recently
  deceased, faithfully reproduced the drawings of Overbeck, Schnorr von
  Carolsfeld, Oscar Pletsch, and Moritz von Schwind. Of living engravers we
  may refer our readers to the excellent examples of skill to be seen in
  the 'Meisterwerke der Holzschneidekunst,' a monthly periodical of great
  merit; and especially to the works of Pfnorr of Darmstadt; Höfel of
  Vienna; Flegel and Weber of Leipsic; Mezger and Vieweg of Brunswick; H.
  Günter, Karl Oertel, Lüttge, and E. Krelb.</p>

  <p>In France no great advance has been made, and most of the engravers
  have been contented to produce work a little above mediocrity. Several
  French publishers have given commissions to English engravers&mdash;Orrin
  Smith, Henry Linton, and others.</p>

  <p>In America great strides have been made, and, in the estimation of
  many excellent judges, the best works ever done by wood-engravers have
  been presented to us in the pages of the illustrated magazines. These
  publications excite <!-- Page 128 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page128"></a>{128}</span>our wonder not only at the great energy
  which is thrown into them, apparently without regard to cost, but at the
  immense success which they have justly achieved. Some critics disapprove
  of the style to which we have just referred, and say it is in too close
  an imitation of steel engraving, but it seems hard to censure works which
  have given unbounded satisfaction to so many thousand lovers of art.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Owing to the invention of various mechanical processes, and the
  perfection to which photography has attained, the art of wood-engraving
  would seem to be in danger of becoming extinct. This is by no means the
  real case, for the brilliant band of wood-engravers which has arisen in
  America, of whom we have just spoken, still continue to give us excellent
  examples of their skill; and especially we may mention the inimitable
  copies of paintings by the Old Masters by Timothy Cole, whose rendering
  of Paul Potter's 'Young Bull' excites our warmest admiration.</p>

  <p>In England, under the influence of Mr. William Morris and his
  followers, a revival of this interesting craft, as practised in the
  fifteenth century, has been set on foot in some of the Schools of
  Art&mdash;notably at Birmingham, where in 1893 the students issued a Book
  of Carols illustrated with original designs, some of which were cut by
  the students themselves. This revival of the earlier and purer methods of
  engraving, coupled with a careful study of the possibilities of the art,
  may be taken as a sign that by no means the last chapter on the history
  of engraving on wood has yet been written.</p>

  <p>At present, much of the new process work which we find in such
  over-abundance in newspapers and magazines is slovenly to the last
  degree. On the other hand, now and then we see beautiful
  results&mdash;the best in the American magazines; let us hope that the
  facile cheapness of this new craft&mdash;art it cannot be
  called&mdash;will in good hands soon achieve something more worthy of our
  regard.</p>

<h5>NOTES</h5>

<div class="note">
  <p><a name="Nt_1" href="#NtA_1">[1]</a> W. H. Willshire, <i>Playing and
  other Cards in the British Museum</i>, 1 vol. 8vo. (1876).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_2" href="#NtA_2">[2]</a> It is often called the Mazarine
  Bible, because a copy was discovered, with notes written in it by the
  illuminator, in the library of Cardinal Mazarin. It is very scarce. In
  1884 Mr. Quaritch bought a very fine copy from the library of Sir John
  Thorold, for which he paid £3,900.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_3" href="#NtA_3">[3]</a> <i>History of Wood-Engraving</i>,
  1883.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_4" href="#NtA_4">[4]</a> An English version, neither
  faithful nor complete, was published in the time of Queen Elizabeth,
  '<i>At London, Printed for Simon Waterson, and are to be sold at his shop
  in St. Paule's Churchyard at Chepegate, 1592.</i>' It is extremely
  scarce. Many of the pages, as giving examples of costume, have lately
  been reprinted by authority of the Science and Art Department.</p>

  <p>There is a French edition of Poliphilo, printed at Paris by Kerver in
  1561, with illustrations in a late florid French style.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_5" href="#NtA_5">[5]</a> In a recent Catalogue, Mr.
  Quaritch offers no less than seven different editions of the illustrated
  'Livre d'Heures' printed by Verard, at prices varying from 60<i>l.</i> to
  200<i>l.</i></p>

  <p><a name="Nt_6" href="#NtA_6">[6]</a> It was printed, with descriptions
  in black-letter, at the Chiswick Press, and published by Joseph Cundall,
  12 Old Bond Street, 1840.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_7" href="#NtA_7">[7]</a> It is now issued by George Bell
  &amp; Sons, who also publish Holbein's Bible Pictures.</p>
